# Email-to-Transaction Linking Implementation

You are about to implement the Email-to-Transaction Linking feature for Joot.

## Pre-Implementation Checklist

Before starting, read these documents in order:

1. **Skill Guide**: `.claude/skills/email-linking/SKILL.md` - Architecture overview and code patterns
2. **Current Phase Tasks**: `design-docs/tasks/phase-{N}-*-tasks.md` - Specific task requirements

## Available Phases

| Phase | Name | Tasks | Focus |
|-------|------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Foundation | P1-001 to P1-027 | Database, navigation, email parsers |
| 2 | Core Matching | P2-001 to P2-035 | Upload, parsing, matching, review queue |
| 3 | User Experience | P3-001 to P3-032 | Mobile, polish, accessibility |
| 4 | Advanced Features | P4-001 to P4-028 | Manual linking, history, settings |

## How to Proceed

Tell me which phase or specific task(s) you want to implement:

**Examples:**
- "Start Phase 1" - Begin with P1-001 and work through foundation tasks
- "Implement P1-011" - Build the Grab email parser specifically
- "Work on database migrations" - Do P1-001, P1-002, P1-003, P1-004
- "Build the review queue" - Implement P2-023 through P2-030

## Recommended Approach

For each task:
1. I'll read the task details from the phase document
2. Check that dependencies are complete
3. Implement following the code patterns in the skill guide
4. Run tests to verify
5. Mark the task complete in the document

## Agent Recommendations

| Task Type | Recommended Agent |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Database migrations | `database-admin` |
| TypeScript services | `typescript-pro` |
| API routes | `backend-architect` |
| React components | `frontend-developer` |
