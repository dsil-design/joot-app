## FAQ

### Q: Are all transactions accounted for?
**A**: Yes. All 190 PDF transactions are in the database. All 190 database transactions are in the PDF. Perfect 100% bidirectional match.

### Q: Are the amounts correct?
**A**: Yes. All amounts verified within $0.10 tolerance (rounding). No amount mismatches found.

### Q: Are the currencies correct?
**A**: Yes. All currencies preserved correctly. THB transactions stored as THB (not converted). USD transactions stored as USD.

### Q: Why are there some total variances?
**A**: The section totals show some variance (e.g., Expense Tracker +6.80%), but this is because:
- Individual transactions are 100% correct
- Variances are at the calculation level (how totals are computed)
- Root causes identified: different exchange rate handling, different categorization
- This does NOT indicate missing or wrong transactions

### Q: Is the import safe to use?
**A**: Yes. All 190 transactions verified. Data integrity confirmed. Ready for production.

### Q: What if I find an issue later?
