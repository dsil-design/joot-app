## üîß 4-Phase Import Process

### PHASE 1: Pre-Flight Analysis

**Agent**: Task tool ‚Üí subagent_type=data-engineer

**Objective**: Analyze CSV and PDF to understand data structure, identify issues, and set expectations BEFORE parsing.

**Prompt**:
```
Analyze May 2025 data from csv_imports/fullImport_20251017.csv and csv_imports/Master Reference PDFs/Budget for Import-page4.pdf using scripts/FINAL_PARSING_RULES.md.

Tasks:
1. Find line numbers for all 4 sections in CSV:
   - Expense Tracker
   - Gross Income Tracker
   - Personal Savings & Investments
   - Florida House Expenses

2. Count transactions per section (raw count before deduplication)

3. Extract GRAND TOTALS from PDF (NOT CSV):
   - Expense Tracker NET total
   - Gross Income total
   - Savings/Investment total
   - Florida House total

4. Calculate expected total: Expense Tracker NET + Florida House + Savings

5. Detect potential duplicates between sections:
   - Compare Expense Tracker vs Florida House (same merchant + amount + date)
   - Document which version to keep (per FINAL_PARSING_RULES.md: keep Expense Tracker)

6. Count tag conditions:
   - Reimbursements: description starts with "Reimbursement:" (income type)
   - Business Expenses: column 4 has "X" (expense with tag)
   - Reimbursables: column 3 has "X" (tracking only, NO tag)
   - Florida House: from Florida House section (expense with tag)
   - Savings/Investment: from Savings section (expense with tag)

7. Identify currency distribution:
   - USD transactions (column 7/9 has value, column 6 no THB)
   - THB transactions (column 6 has "THB XXX")
   - Mixed/other patterns

8. Verify parsing script correctness:
   - Read scripts/parse-may-2025.js
   - Verify it uses Column 6 for THB (NOT Column 8 conversion)
   - Verify it uses Column 7/9 for USD (NOT Column 8 conversion)
   - Flag if script needs correction

9. Compare to previous months:
   - September 2025: 159 transactions, 23 reimbursements, ~70 THB
   - August 2025: 225 transactions, 32 reimbursements, 82 THB
   - July 2025: 176 transactions, 26 reimbursements, ~90 THB
   - June 2025: 190 transactions, 27 reimbursements, 85 THB
   - Flag significant structural differences

10. Identify anomalies:
    - Missing amounts
    - Invalid dates (e.g., wrong year)
    - Unusual patterns
    - Data quality issues

Output Files:
- scripts/MAY-2025-PREFLIGHT-REPORT.md
- scripts/MAY-2025-RED-FLAGS.md (for tracking anomalies/issues for later review)

Report must include:
- Line number ranges for each section
- Transaction counts per section
- Expected totals from PDF (source of truth)
- Expected total calculation
- Duplicate detection results with line numbers
- Tag distribution preview (counts)
- Currency breakdown (USD vs THB vs other)
- Parsing script verification status
- Comparison to previous months
- Red flags or structural differences
- Parsing strategy recommendations

Red Flag Log Must Include:
For EACH anomaly/issue discovered:
- Transaction details (date, description, amount, line number)
- Issue type (missing amount, invalid date, duplicate, parsing error, etc.)
- Severity (CRITICAL / WARNING / INFO)
- Phase detected (Pre-Flight / Parsing / Import / Validation)
- Status (OPEN / RESOLVED / ACCEPTED)
- Notes/context

CRITICAL VERIFICATION:
- Verify rent transaction should be THB 35,000.00 (NOT ~$1074)
- Verify parsing script uses Column 6 for THB amounts
- Verify parsing script does NOT use Column 8 (conversion column)

This is critical pre-import validation - flag any anomalies before we proceed to parsing.

IMPORTANT: Create both output files (report and red flag log) with all findings. Return a summary of the key findings including any red flags that need human review before proceeding.
```

**Output**:
- `scripts/MAY-2025-PREFLIGHT-REPORT.md`
- `scripts/MAY-2025-RED-FLAGS.md`

**Human Checkpoint**: ‚è∏Ô∏è Review pre-flight report and red flag log, address any critical issues before Phase 2.

---

### PHASE 2: Parse & Prepare

**Agent**: Task tool ‚Üí subagent_type=data-engineer

**Objective**: Parse CSV data following FINAL_PARSING_RULES.md exactly, producing clean JSON for import.

**Prerequisites**:
- ‚úÖ Pre-flight report reviewed and approved
- ‚úÖ Parsing script verified/corrected
- ‚úÖ Line ranges identified

**Prompt**:
```
Parse May 2025 transactions following scripts/FINAL_PARSING_RULES.md exactly.

Source: csv_imports/fullImport_20251017.csv

Line Ranges: [from pre-flight report]

Critical Requirements:

1. **Currency Handling (MOST IMPORTANT):**
   - THB transactions: Use Column 6 value (e.g., "THB 35000.00")
   - USD transactions: Use Column 7 or Column 9 (subtotal) value
   - NEVER use Column 8 (conversion column)
   - Store currency as 'THB' or 'USD' in the currency field
   - Store amount as the ORIGINAL currency amount (e.g., 35000 for THB, not 1074)

2. Parse all 4 sections:
   - Expense Tracker (lines X-Y from pre-flight)
   - Gross Income Tracker (lines X-Y)
   - Personal Savings & Investments (lines X-Y)
   - Florida House Expenses (lines X-Y)

3. Apply tag logic:
   - "Reimbursement": description starts with "Reimbursement:" ‚Üí income type + tag
   - "Florida House": from Florida House section ‚Üí expense type + tag
   - "Business Expense": column 4 has "X" ‚Üí expense type + tag
   - "Savings/Investment": from Savings section ‚Üí expense type + tag
   - Reimbursable (column 3): NO tag, tracking only

4. Handle duplicates:
   - Remove duplicates between Expense Tracker and Florida House
   - Keep Expense Tracker version per FINAL_PARSING_RULES.md
   - Document which transactions were removed

5. Date conversion:
   - "Monday, May 1, 2025" ‚Üí "2025-05-01"
   - "5/1/2025" ‚Üí "2025-05-01"
   - Apply any date corrections identified in pre-flight

6. Transaction structure:
   ```json
   {
     "date": "2025-05-01",
     "description": "This Month's Rent",
     "merchant": "Landlord",
     "payment_method": "Bangkok Bank Account",
     "amount": 35000,
     "currency": "THB",
     "transaction_type": "expense",
     "tags": []
   }
   ```

Expected Outputs (from pre-flight):
- Total transactions: [from pre-flight]
- Transaction types: [expenses vs income counts]
- Tag distribution:
  - Reimbursement: [count]
  - Florida House: [count]
  - Business Expense: [count]
  - Savings/Investment: [count]
- Currency split: [USD vs THB counts]
- Duplicates removed: [list]

Output Files:
1. scripts/may-2025-CORRECTED.json - Parsed transaction data
2. scripts/MAY-2025-PARSE-REPORT.md - Detailed parsing report
3. scripts/MAY-2025-RED-FLAGS.md - APPEND new issues found during parsing

Parse Report Must Include:
- Transaction counts by section
- Transaction counts by type (expense vs income)
- Tag distribution (actual counts)
- Currency distribution (USD vs THB)
- Duplicates removed (with details)
- Expected totals from CSV
- Date corrections applied (if any)
- Warnings or issues encountered
- Sample transactions (first 5 from each section)

Critical Verification:
- Rent transaction MUST be 35000 THB (NOT ~1074 USD)
- All THB transactions stored as THB with original amounts
- All USD transactions stored as USD with original amounts

Red Flag Logging:
- APPEND any new parsing errors, currency issues, or anomalies to scripts/MAY-2025-RED-FLAGS.md
- Include line numbers, transaction details, and resolution status
- Flag duplicates removed for human review

IMPORTANT: Run the parsing script: node scripts/parse-may-2025.js and create all output files (JSON, report, and updated red flag log). Return a summary showing transaction counts, rent verification, currency distribution, and ready-for-import confirmation.
```

**Output**:
- `scripts/may-2025-CORRECTED.json`
- `scripts/MAY-2025-PARSE-REPORT.md`
- `scripts/MAY-2025-RED-FLAGS.md` (updated)

**Human Checkpoint**: ‚è∏Ô∏è Verify rent = 35000 THB, currency split correct, review red flags, approve for import.

---

### PHASE 3: Database Import

**Execution**: Direct command (no agent needed)

**Prerequisites**:
- ‚úÖ Parse report reviewed and approved
- ‚úÖ Rent transaction verified as 35000 THB
- ‚úÖ Currency split verified

**Command**:
```bash
node scripts/db/import-month.js --file=scripts/may-2025-CORRECTED.json --month=2025-05
```

**What This Does**:
- Matches existing vendors (197+ in database)
- Matches existing payment methods (32+ in database)
- Matches existing tags (Reimbursement, Florida House, Savings/Investment, Business Expense)
- Creates new vendors/payment methods only when no match found
- Skips duplicate transactions (same date + description + amount + vendor)
- Inserts transactions in batches of 50
- Creates transaction_tag relationships
- Reports: new vendors, new payment methods, import counts

**Expected Output**:
```
üì• INCREMENTAL MONTH IMPORT

- Acceptance: All match PDF

LEVEL 6: 100% Comprehensive 1:1 PDF Verification

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: This is NOT a spot check or sample-based verification. You must verify EVERY transaction in both directions (PDF‚ÜíDB and DB‚ÜíPDF).

Task 6.1: PDF ‚Üí Database Verification (100% Coverage)

For EACH section in the PDF:
1. Extract ALL transaction rows (ignore headers/totals/summaries)
2. For EVERY transaction, search for match in database:
   - Date: exact match
   - Description: fuzzy match ‚â•80% similarity acceptable
   - Amount: within $0.10 tolerance
   - Currency: exact match (THB or USD)
3. Create complete verification table showing ALL transactions

Items to IGNORE from PDF (document but don't count as missing):
- Section header rows
- Column header rows
- Daily total summary rows
- Grand total rows
- Blank/separator rows
- Date-only rows (calendar markers)

Track statistics:
- Total PDF transaction rows: XXX
- Found in DB: XXX (XX.X%)
- Not found: X (list EVERY missing transaction)
