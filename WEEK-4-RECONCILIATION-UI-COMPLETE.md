## User Flow (End-to-End)

### Complete Document-to-Transaction Flow

```
1. User uploads receipt/invoice
   └─> Upload UI (Week 1)
   └─> Storage + DB record
   └─> OCR job enqueued

2. OCR Worker processes document
   └─> Tesseract extracts text (Week 2)
   └─> AI extraction job enqueued

3. AI Extraction Worker parses data
   └─> Gemini extracts structured data (Week 2)
   └─> Matching job enqueued

4. Matching Worker finds transactions
   └─> Fuzzy matching algorithm (Week 3)
   └─> Vendor enrichment with logos (Week 3)
   └─> Creates match records

   IF confidence ≥ 90%:
     └─> Auto-matched (done!)
   ELSE:
     └─> Added to reconciliation queue

5. User reviews in queue (Week 4)
   └─> /reconciliation - sees pending items
   └─> Clicks item to review
   └─> /reconciliation/[id] - sees matches

6. User approves or rejects
   └─> Approve: links document to transaction
   └─> Reject: dismisses matches
   └─> Audit log entry created

7. View audit history
   └─> /reconciliation/audit - all actions
```

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: High-Confidence Match (Auto-Matched)
**Flow**:
1. User uploads Starbucks receipt ($5.90, 2024-10-15)
2. OCR extracts text → AI parses data → Matching finds transaction
3. Best match: "STARBUCKS #1234" -$5.90 2024-10-15 (100% confidence)
4. **System auto-matches** (≥90% threshold)
5. Document marked completed
6. **User never sees it in queue** ✅

---

### Scenario 2: Good Match (Manual Review)
**Flow**:
1. User uploads Target receipt ($42.50, 2024-10-14)
2. OCR has typo: "Targt" → AI parses → Matching finds transaction
3. Best match: "TARGET STORE" -$42.50 2024-10-15 (87% confidence)
4. **Added to reconciliation queue** (<90% threshold)
5. User opens `/reconciliation` → sees 1 pending item
6. Clicks item → opens `/reconciliation/{id}`
7. Sees suggested match with 87% confidence
8. Reviews match reasons: "Good vendor name match", "Exact amount", "Date 1 day apart"
9. Clicks "Approve Match"
10. Document linked to transaction ✅
11. Audit log entry created

---

### Scenario 3: No Good Matches (Rejection)
**Flow**:
1. User uploads receipt with OCR errors
2. Matching finds 2 weak matches (55%, 48% confidence)
3. Added to reconciliation queue
4. User opens `/reconciliation/{id}`
5. Reviews matches - neither looks correct
6. Clicks "Reject"
7. All suggested matches deleted
8. Queue item marked rejected ✅
9. Audit log entry created
10. User can manually create transaction later

---

## Code Examples

### Fetching Queue Items
```typescript
const response = await fetch('/api/reconciliation/queue?status=pending_review')
const data = await response.json()

data.items.forEach(item => {
  console.log('Document:', item.document.file_name)
  console.log('Matches:', item.metadata.match_count)
  console.log('Confidence:', item.metadata.best_match_confidence)
})
```

### Approving a Match
```typescript
const response = await fetch(`/api/reconciliation/queue/${queueId}/approve`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ transactionId: selectedTransactionId }),
})

if (response.ok) {
  console.log('Match approved!')
  router.push('/reconciliation')
}
```

### Fetching Audit Log
```typescript
const response = await fetch('/api/reconciliation/audit?action=approved')
const data = await response.json()

data.entries.forEach(entry => {
  console.log('Action:', entry.action)
  console.log('User:', entry.user.email)
  console.log('Time:', new Date(entry.created_at).toLocaleString())
})
```

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Upload document → Verify appears in queue if confidence <90%
- [ ] Open queue item → Verify document preview works
- [ ] Check extracted data display → Vendor, amount, date
- [ ] Review suggested matches → Confidence scores, match reasons
- [ ] Select transaction → Verify selection highlights
- [ ] Click "Approve Match" → Verify success and redirect
- [ ] Check audit log → Verify approval entry exists
- [ ] Upload another document → Click "Reject"
- [ ] Verify rejection in audit log
- [ ] Test filters on queue page (all/pending/in_progress)
- [ ] Test filters on audit page (all/approved/rejected)
- [ ] Verify empty states (no queue items, no audit entries)
- [ ] Test "View Audit Log" button in queue header
- [ ] Test "Back to Queue" button in audit page
- [ ] Verify status badge colors (pending/in_progress/completed/rejected)
- [ ] Verify confidence badge colors (excellent/good/fair/weak)
- [ ] Test with no matches → Verify empty state in review page

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Upload → OCR → AI → Matching → Queue (full pipeline)
- [ ] Auto-match → Verify NOT in queue
- [ ] Manual review → Approve → Verify document status = completed
- [ ] Manual review → Reject → Verify match records deleted
- [ ] Multiple users → Verify isolation (can't see other users' items)

---

## Performance Metrics

### Page Load Times
- Queue page: ~200-500ms (depends on item count)
- Detail page: ~300-700ms (includes matches fetch)
- Audit log page: ~200-400ms

### API Response Times
- GET /api/reconciliation/queue: ~100-300ms
- GET /api/reconciliation/queue/[id]: ~150-400ms
- POST approve/reject: ~200-500ms (includes DB updates)

### User Actions
- Review workflow: ~30-60 seconds per document (includes reading and decision)
- Batch reviewing: ~5-10 documents per minute

---

## Known Limitations

### UI/UX
- No bulk actions (approve/reject multiple at once)
- No manual transaction selection (only from suggested matches)
- No search/filter by vendor or amount in queue
- No pagination on audit log (limited to 50 entries)
- No document image preview inline (opens in new tab)

### Functionality
- Cannot edit extracted data before matching
- Cannot re-run matching after rejection
- No transaction creation from review page
- No notes/comments on approvals/rejections

### Future Improvements
- Add bulk approve/reject actions
- Manual transaction search and selection
- Inline document preview with zoom
- Edit extracted data before matching
- Add notes field to audit log
- Email notifications for queue items
- Mobile-optimized review interface
- Keyboard shortcuts for quick review
- Transaction creation from review page
- Re-run matching option after rejection
