## Technical Details

### File Structure
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ documents/
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ upload/
â”‚   â”‚           â””â”€â”€ route.ts          # Upload API endpoint
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ documents/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx                  # Documents list page
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ upload/
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ page.tsx              # Upload page
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ documents/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ FileUpload.tsx            # Drag-drop component
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ UploadProgress.tsx        # Progress tracking component
â””â”€â”€ lib/
    â”œâ”€â”€ services/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ storage-service.ts        # Storage operations (updated)
    â””â”€â”€ utils/
        â””â”€â”€ file-validation.ts        # Validation utilities
```

### Validation Rules (Matches Backend)
- **Max File Size**: 10MB (10 * 1024 * 1024 bytes)
- **Allowed MIME Types**:
  - `application/pdf` (PDF documents)
  - `image/jpeg` (JPEG images)
  - `image/png` (PNG images)
  - `message/rfc822` (EML email files)

### Upload Flow
1. User drags/selects file
2. Client-side validation
3. File preview shown (if image)
4. User clicks "Upload Document"
5. FormData sent to `/api/documents/upload`
6. Backend validates and uploads to storage
7. Progress bar shows simulated upload progress
8. Image compression and thumbnail generation (if applicable)
9. Database record created
10. Success state with compression savings
11. Auto-redirect to documents list

### API Response Format
```typescript
{
  success: true,
  document: {
    id: string
    fileName: string
    fileType: 'pdf' | 'image' | 'email'
    fileSizeBytes: number
    storagePath: string
    thumbnailPath: string | null
    processingStatus: 'pending'
    createdAt: string
  },
  uploadMetadata: {
    originalSize: number
    compressedSize: number | undefined
    percentSaved: number | undefined
  }
}
```

## Styling

All components use:
- Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Dark mode support via `dark:` variants
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Consistent color scheme:
  - Blue for primary actions and progress
  - Green for success states
  - Red for error states
  - Gray for neutral states

## Next Steps (Week 2)

### Week 2, Days 1-2: OCR Processing
- Implement Tesseract.js OCR extraction
- Create OCR processing job queue
- Store extracted text in `document_extractions` table
- Background processing with status updates

### Week 2, Days 3-4: AI Data Extraction
- Integrate Google Gemini 1.5 Flash API
- Parse vendor, amount, date, currency from OCR text
- Store structured data in `document_extractions`
- Confidence scoring for extracted fields

---

## Routes Available

After this work, the following routes are accessible:
- `/documents` - Documents list page (empty state)
- `/documents/upload` - Upload document page

---

## Database Integration

### Tables Used
- **`documents`** - Main document metadata
  - File info, storage paths, processing status
  - Created during upload via API

### Storage Buckets Used
- **`documents`** - Private bucket for original files
- **`thumbnails`** - Public bucket for image previews
- **`vendor-logos`** - Not yet used (Week 3)

---

## Known Issues / Future Improvements

1. **Progress Tracking**: Currently simulated (not real upload progress)
   - Real progress would require chunked upload or WebSocket
   - Simulated progress provides good UX for now

2. **Documents List API**: Not yet implemented
   - Documents page shows empty state
   - Will be implemented in Week 2 when there's data to display

3. **Thumbnail Display**: Thumbnails stored but not yet displayed in list
   - Need to implement signed URL generation
   - Will be added in Week 2

4. **Batch Upload**: Only single file upload supported
   - Could be enhanced to support multiple files
   - Not in scope for MVP

---

## Commits

This work includes:
1. Created upload API endpoint
2. Built drag-drop FileUpload component
3. Built UploadProgress component
4. Created upload page with full workflow
5. Created documents list page (empty state)
6. Added file validation utilities
7. Fixed prefer-const warning in storage-service
