## Questions & Answers

### Q: Why is this redesign needed?
**A:** Current form has critical mobile usability issues:
- Sticky footer appears floating (unprofessional)
- Touch targets too small (accessibility issue)
- Excessive scrolling required (UX friction)
- Pattern doesn't match industry standards

### Q: What's the risk of these changes?
**A:** Phase 1 risk is LOW:
- Only CSS/markup changes
- No logic modifications
- Easy to rollback
- Comprehensive testing plan
- Simple verification

### Q: How long will implementation take?
**A:** Phase 1: 4-7 hours total
- Footer fix: 2-4 hours
- Touch targets: 1-2 hours
- Spacing: 1 hour
Plus testing time

### Q: What if users don't like the changes?
**A:** Phase 1 changes are improvements, not pattern changes:
- Professional appearance (objective improvement)
- Accessibility compliance (legal requirement)
- Reduced scrolling (measurable improvement)
- Industry-standard patterns (familiar to users)

Rollback is simple if needed.

### Q: When should we do Phase 2 and 3?
**A:** Only after Phase 1 is:
- Deployed successfully
- Validated with metrics
- Confirmed by users

Phase 3 requires user testing before full rollout.

### Q: How does this compare to competitors?
**A:** Research shows:
- 100% of analyzed apps use edge-to-edge footers
- All major apps (Revolut, N26, Wise) use integrated amount/currency
- Proposed changes bring Joot to industry parity
- Current pattern is unconventional
