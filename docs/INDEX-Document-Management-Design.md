## Key Decisions & Rationale

### Design Decisions

**1. Desktop-first (not mobile-first)**
- **Rationale:** Reconciliation requires careful review, side-by-side comparison
- **Impact:** Mobile limited to camera capture and quick approvals
- **Document:** UX Design, Section 8

**2. Split view for review queue (not tabs)**
- **Rationale:** See both unmatched and matched simultaneously, reduce context switching
- **Impact:** Desktop-optimized layout, better workflow visibility
- **Document:** UX Design, Section 3.2; Visual Design, Appendix A

**3. User-configurable auto-match threshold (not fixed)**
- **Rationale:** Financial data sensitivity varies by user, allow customization
- **Impact:** Three modes: manual, semi-auto, full-auto
- **Document:** UX Design, Section 6.1

**4. Virtual receipts for statement line items**
- **Rationale:** Enable 1:1 matching while preserving full statement access
- **Impact:** Complex statement processing, better user experience
- **Document:** UX Design, Section 2 (Flow D)

**5. Transparent confidence scoring (not black box)**
- **Rationale:** Build user trust through explainability
- **Impact:** Show matching factors, clear thresholds, educational
- **Document:** UX Design, Section 4.2; Visual Design, Section 3

### Technical Decisions

**1. AWS Textract for OCR (not Tesseract)**
- **Rationale:** Higher accuracy (95%+ vs 85%), managed service, scales easily
- **Trade-off:** Higher cost ($1.50 per 1000 pages vs free)
- **Document:** Implementation Roadmap, Phase 2

**2. Background job queue for processing**
- **Rationale:** Long-running OCR, don't block user, handle failures
- **Implementation:** Bull/BullMQ with Redis
- **Document:** Implementation Roadmap, Phase 2

**3. JSON columns for extracted data and document IDs**
- **Rationale:** Flexible schema, no joins needed, faster queries
- **Trade-off:** Harder to index/query deeply nested data
- **Document:** Implementation Roadmap, Phase 2-3

**4. Vendor-specific parsers over pure ML**
- **Rationale:** Structured documents (Grab, Lazada) have consistent formats, higher accuracy
- **Fallback:** ML for unstructured documents
- **Document:** Implementation Roadmap, Phase 2

## FAQ

**Q: How long will this take to build?**
A: 16 weeks for full implementation (Phases 1-4). Minimum viable feature (Phases 1-3) ready in 12 weeks.

**Q: What's the total investment required?**
A: ~$60K development (team costs) + ~$8.6K/year operating costs (cloud services, tools).

**Q: When will we see ROI?**
A: Expected break-even at 18 months based on +15% retention and +$42K annual incremental revenue.

**Q: What's the biggest risk?**
A: User trust in automatic matching. Mitigated by transparent confidence scores, manual review option, and easy undo.

**Q: Can we launch faster with fewer features?**
A: Yes. Phases 1-2 (upload + extraction) could launch in 8 weeks, but without auto-matching (the main value prop).

**Q: What if OCR accuracy is too low?**
A: Start with vendor-specific parsers for structured documents (higher accuracy). Manual entry always available as fallback.

**Q: Is mobile support required for launch?**
A: Camera capture is nice-to-have (Phase 4). Core desktop features can launch without it.

**Q: How many users will adopt this feature?**
A: Target: 50% of active users upload at least 1 document within 30 days of launch.
