# Executive Summary: Document Management Implementation Plan v2.0

**Project:** Joot Document Management & Transaction Reconciliation
**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Timeline:** 8-12 weeks to MVP
**Investment:** $106,720 total (development + year 1 operations)
**Expected ROI:** 30-month break-even, 70%+ gross margins

---

## TL;DR - 60 Second Brief

We're building a document management system that lets users upload receipts/statements and automatically match them to transactions. The system prioritizes:

1. **Desktop-first power users** - Large screens for side-by-side review
2. **Silent auto-approval** - Matches ≥95% confidence auto-approved (with 24hr undo)
3. **Manual upload MVP** - Drag-drop .eml files now, email forwarding later
4. **Basic vendor enrichment** - Logo + category only (free tier)

**Timeline:** 12 weeks in 4 phases
**Cost:** ~$90K dev + ~$5K/year operations
**Impact:** 70% reduction in manual entry time, 50% fewer errors

---

## Why This Matters

### User Pain Point
Users spend **30-45 minutes per week** manually entering transactions. They make **15-20% errors** and lose receipts. This erodes trust in their financial data.

### Our Solution
Upload documents → Auto-extract data → Auto-match to transactions → Review if needed

**Result:**
- 70%+ time savings
- 50%+ error reduction
- Higher user retention (+15%)
- Competitive differentiation

---

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Upload & Storage (Weeks 1-3)
**What:** Users can upload documents and see them in a library
**Who:** 1 backend engineer + 1 frontend engineer
**Outcome:** Upload working, documents stored securely

### Phase 2: Processing & Extraction (Weeks 4-6)
**What:** OCR + AI extraction of amount, date, vendor
**Who:** Full team (add QA engineer)
**Outcome:** 85%+ extraction accuracy, <30s processing time

### Phase 3: Matching & Reconciliation (Weeks 7-9)
**What:** Auto-match documents to transactions, review queue
**Who:** Full team
**Outcome:** 85%+ matching accuracy, auto-approval working

### Phase 4: Polish & Advanced (Weeks 10-12)
**What:** Vendor enrichment, mobile camera, accessibility
**Who:** Full team
**Outcome:** WCAG AA compliant, Lighthouse >90, ready for launch

---

## Technical Architecture (High-Level)

```
User Uploads Document
       ↓
Supabase Storage (secure, encrypted)
       ↓
Background Job Queue (Redis + Bull)
       ↓
OCR (Tesseract → Google Vision fallback)
       ↓
AI Extraction (Claude 3.5 Haiku)
       ↓
Fuzzy Matching (Fuse.js, local)
       ↓
Auto-Approve if ≥95% confidence
       ↓
User Reviews Queue or Sees Auto-Match Badge
```

**Cost per Document:** ~$0.03 (mostly AI extraction)

---

## User Experience Flow

### Happy Path (95%+ confidence)
1. User drags 10 receipts onto upload zone
2. System processes in background (20-30 seconds)
3. 8/10 auto-matched silently (95%+ confidence)
4. User sees "8 documents auto-matched" notification
5. Transactions show "auto-matched" badge
6. User can undo within 24 hours

### Review Path (60-95% confidence)
1. User goes to Review Queue
2. Sees split view: Unmatched (left) | Matched (right)
3. Clicks medium-confidence match
4. Side-by-side comparison modal opens
5. Reviews matching factors
6. Approves or rejects
7. Transaction updated

### Manual Path (no match)
1. User sees unmatched document in queue
2. Clicks "Create Transaction from Document"
3. Pre-filled form with extracted data
4. Edits if needed, saves
5. Document auto-attached to new transaction

---

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Desktop-First (Not Mobile-First)
**Why:** Reconciliation requires side-by-side comparison, bulk uploads easier with drag-drop
**Trade-off:** Mobile users limited to camera capture only
**Future:** May add mobile review UI in v2.0 if demand exists

### 2. Silent Auto-Approval (Not Always Require Review)
**Why:** Reduces friction for high-confidence matches, time savings
**Trade-off:** Risk of incorrect matches
**Mitigation:** Conservative 95% threshold, 24hr undo, clear badge, audit log

### 3. Hybrid OCR (Not Cloud-Only)
**Why:** 70% of docs work with free Tesseract, saves 3x cost, privacy
**Trade-off:** More complex routing logic
**Result:** $0.001/doc average vs $0.003 cloud-only

### 4. Manual Email Upload (Not Email Forwarding)
**Why:** Saves 3-4 weeks development time, validates PMF first
**Trade-off:** Less convenient for users
**Future:** Email integration planned for v2.0 (Month 4-6)

### 5. Basic Vendor Enrichment (Not Full Data)
**Why:** Logo + category enough for visual appeal, free tier
**Trade-off:** No contact info, address, hours
**Future:** Advanced enrichment in v2.0 if needed

## Risk Assessment

### High-Impact Risks

**1. Users Don't Trust Auto-Approval** [Probability: Medium]
- **Mitigation:** Transparent confidence scores, show matching factors, easy undo, opt-out available
- **Fallback:** Default to manual review mode, let users opt-in

**2. OCR/Extraction Accuracy Too Low** [Probability: Medium]
- **Mitigation:** Start with vendor-specific parsers (higher accuracy), manual entry always available
- **Fallback:** Improve prompts iteratively, add fine-tuning in v2.0

**3. Matching False Positives** [Probability: Medium]
- **Mitigation:** Conservative 95% threshold, user review queue, 24hr undo, audit log
- **Fallback:** Raise threshold to 98%, require review for all matches

### Medium-Impact Risks

**4. Cloud Costs Exceed Budget** [Probability: Low]
- **Mitigation:** File size limits, aggressive caching, Tesseract-first, budget alerts
- **Fallback:** User storage quotas, premium tiers for heavy users

**5. Feature Complexity Overwhelms Users** [Probability: Medium]
- **Mitigation:** Onboarding tutorial, progressive disclosure, simple defaults, help tooltips
- **Fallback:** Simplify UI, hide advanced features

**Overall Risk Level:** Medium (well-mitigated)

## Questions & Answers

**Q: Why 12 weeks? Can we launch faster?**
A: Phases 1-2 (upload + extraction) could launch in 6-8 weeks, but without auto-matching (the main value prop). We recommend full 12-week timeline for complete MVP.

**Q: What if matching accuracy is too low?**
A: We start with vendor-specific parsers for structured documents (higher accuracy). Manual entry always available. Accuracy improves with user corrections over time.

**Q: Is mobile camera capture required for launch?**
A: No, it's Phase 4 (nice-to-have). Core desktop features can launch without it. Mobile users can email receipts to themselves and upload from desktop as workaround.

**Q: What happens if a user wants email forwarding now?**
A: They can manually drag .eml files from their email client. It's 2 extra clicks but functional. Email integration comes in v2.0 (Month 4-6).

**Q: How do we handle disputes on auto-matches?**
A: 24-hour undo window, clear audit log, easy "unmatch" button. If user reports issues, we can raise threshold or disable auto-approval for that user.

**Q: What's the biggest risk?**
A: User trust in automation. Mitigated by transparent confidence scores, manual review option, easy undo, and audit trail. We default to cautious thresholds.
