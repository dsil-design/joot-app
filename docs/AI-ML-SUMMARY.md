# AI/ML Document Processing - Executive Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the AI/ML architecture for Joot's document processing and transaction matching system.

## Key Decisions

### 1. Use Pre-trained LLMs (Not Custom Models)
**Why**: Faster to market, handles edge cases, no training data needed
**Tools**: Claude 3.5 Haiku (primary), GPT-4o Mini (backup)
**Trade-off**: Slightly higher cost vs speed to market

### 2. Hybrid Local/Cloud Processing
**Why**: Balance privacy, cost, and accuracy
**Strategy**:
- 70% documents: Free local OCR (Tesseract)
- 20% documents: Cloud OCR (Google Vision)
- 10% documents: LLM vision (Claude)
**Result**: $0.001 average OCR cost (vs $0.003 cloud-only)

### 3. Real-time + Batch Modes
**Why**: Flexibility for different use cases
**Real-time**: User uploads, need immediate results (10s)
**Batch**: Email imports, monthly statements (overnight)

### 4. Transparent Confidence Scoring
**Why**: Build user trust, improve accuracy over time
**Thresholds**:
- 90%+: Auto-match
- 60-90%: Suggest matches
- <60%: Manual review

### 5. Aggressive Caching
**Why**: 50% cost reduction
**Strategy**:
- Vendor enrichments: Permanent
- Embeddings: Permanent
- OCR results: 24 hours

             (Vision)        ↓                      (Local)   (Cached)
                         Google V.
                        (Fallback)
```

**Breakeven**: 3 months per user (including acquisition cost)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **API outages**: Multi-provider fallback (Claude ↔ GPT)
2. **Cost overruns**: Budget alerts at 80%, hard limits at 100%
3. **Low accuracy**: Confidence thresholds, manual review flow
4. **Latency**: Async processing, progress indicators

### Business Risks
1. **Pricing competition**: Focus on accuracy, not price
2. **API price increases**: Multi-provider, consider fine-tuning
3. **Slow adoption**: Free tier for trials, freemium model
4. **Privacy concerns**: Local-first option, transparent policies

## Competitive Advantages

1. **Hybrid approach**: Local (free) + cloud (accurate) = best of both
2. **Multi-currency**: Support USD, THB, EUR, etc.
3. **Learning system**: Gets better with user feedback
4. **Transparent AI**: Show confidence scores, allow corrections
5. **Cost-effective**: 3 cents/doc vs competitors at 10+ cents

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Full Custom Model (Rejected)
**Pros**: Potentially lower long-term cost
**Cons**: 6+ months to train, requires labeled data, harder to maintain
**Decision**: Use pre-trained, revisit in 12 months

### 2. Cloud-Only Processing (Rejected)
**Pros**: Highest accuracy
**Cons**: 3x cost, privacy concerns, vendor lock-in
**Decision**: Hybrid with local-first

### 3. No AI (Manual Only) (Rejected)
**Pros**: Zero AI cost
**Cons**: Poor UX, slow, error-prone
**Decision**: AI is core value proposition

## Questions & Answers

### Q: Why Claude over GPT?
**A**: Similar accuracy, better vision capabilities, no training on API data by default, comparable pricing

### Q: Why not fine-tune?
**A**: Not worth it until 1000+ labeled examples and proven product-market fit. Pre-trained models are 75%+ accurate already.

### Q: Why local OCR first?
**A**: Free, instant, private. 70% of receipts are high-quality and work fine with Tesseract.

### Q: What if accuracy is too low?
**A**: Confidence thresholds prevent bad auto-matches. Users can always correct, and system learns.

### Q: How to handle budget overruns?
**A**: Hard limits at user tier level, alerts at 80% of budget, fallback to slower/cheaper processing

## Next Steps

1. **Set up API keys** (Anthropic, OpenAI)
2. **Install dependencies** (see Quick Start guide)
3. **Implement MVP** (OCR + extraction)
4. **Test with real receipts** (start with high-quality images)
5. **Add matching** (Fuse.js fuzzy matching)
6. **Deploy to staging** (test with beta users)
7. **Monitor costs** (daily dashboard)
8. **Iterate on prompts** (improve accuracy)
