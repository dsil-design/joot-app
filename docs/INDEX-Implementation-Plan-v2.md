## Next Steps

### If Approved (Stakeholders Say "Go")

1. **Week 0 (Pre-Development):**
   - Assign development team (2 engineers, 1 QA, 1 designer)
   - Set up infrastructure (Supabase Storage, Redis, API keys)
   - Conduct concept testing (optional, n=8)

2. **Week 1 (Phase 1 Begins):**
   - Database schema migration
   - Storage integration
   - Upload API development

3. **Week 4 (Phase 1 Demo):**
   - Show upload + library working
   - Collect stakeholder feedback
   - Begin Phase 2

4. **Week 12 (Launch):**
   - Canary rollout (10% → 50% → 100%)
   - Monitor metrics daily
   - Collect user feedback

### If Not Approved Yet

1. **Address concerns:**
   - Budget too high? Scope down to Phases 1-2 only
   - Timeline too long? Hire additional engineer
   - Risk too high? Start with beta testing (20 users)

2. **Additional validation:**
   - Conduct concept testing first
   - Prototype in Figma for stakeholder review
   - Survey existing users for interest

3. **Schedule follow-up:**
   - 1-2 weeks to address concerns
   - Revised plan if needed
   - Re-present for approval

## FAQ

**Q: Can we launch faster?**
A: Phases 1-2 (upload + extraction) in 6-8 weeks, but no auto-matching (main value prop).

**Q: What if accuracy is too low?**
A: Start with vendor-specific parsers (higher accuracy), manual entry always available, improve iteratively.

**Q: Is mobile required?**
A: Camera capture is Phase 4 (nice-to-have). Desktop features can launch without it.

**Q: What about email forwarding?**
A: Users can drag .eml files now. Email integration planned for v2.0 (Month 4-6).

**Q: How do we handle disputes?**
A: 24-hour undo, clear audit log, easy unmatch button, raise threshold if needed.

**Q: What's the biggest risk?**
A: User trust in automation. Mitigated by transparent scoring, manual review option, easy undo.
