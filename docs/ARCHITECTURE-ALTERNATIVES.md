Deployment: 3-5 days (CI/CD setup)
Total: 8-11 weeks
```

### Self-Hosted Stack Details

**1. Web Server: Caddy**
```
Why Caddy:
- Automatic HTTPS (Let's Encrypt)
- Simple configuration
- Built-in reverse proxy
- Zero-config HTTP/2

Alternative: Nginx (more complex, more flexible)
```

**2. Database: PostgreSQL**
```
Why PostgreSQL:

- Excellent JSON support
- Strong ACID guarantees
- Mature ecosystem

Setup:
$ sudo apt install postgresql
$ sudo -u postgres createdb joot_app
```

**3. Storage: MinIO**
```
Why MinIO:
- S3-compatible API
- Self-hosted object storage
- Very fast, efficient
- Easy to migrate to AWS S3 later

Setup:
$ docker run -p 9000:9000 minio/minio server /data
```

**4. LLM: Ollama + Llama 3.2**
```
Why Ollama:
- Run LLMs locally for free
- No API costs
- No rate limits
- Privacy-preserving

Setup:
$ curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
$ ollama pull llama3.2:1b

Limitations:
- Slower than cloud APIs
- Lower quality than GPT-4/Gemini Pro
- Requires GPU for good performance
```

**5. OCR: Tesseract Server**
```
Why Tesseract:
- Same as cloud option
- Self-hosted version
- Very accurate

Setup:
$ sudo apt install tesseract-ocr
$ npm install node-tesseract-ocr
```

## Option 3: Hybrid Cloud + Self-Hosted

**Stack**: Supabase (DB + Auth) + Self-hosted (Processing + Storage)

### Architecture Diagram
```
User Browser
    ↓
Vercel (Next.js frontend)
    ↓
├─> Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth)
└─> DigitalOcean (Processing + MinIO)
```

### Pros
- Best of both worlds
- Use Supabase for DB/Auth (hard parts)
- Self-host expensive parts (storage, processing)
- More cost-efficient at scale
- Still relatively easy to manage

### Cons
- More complex architecture
- Two systems to maintain
- Network latency between services
- More difficult debugging
- Need DevOps knowledge

### Cost Analysis
```
Free tier: $0/month (Supabase Free + no self-hosting yet)
Growth: $30-40/month (Supabase Pro + $12 droplet)
Scale: $100-150/month (Supabase Pro + $48 droplet + R2)
```

### Best For
- Cost optimization at scale
- Teams with some DevOps experience
- Splitting expensive operations off cloud
- Gradual migration from full cloud

### Implementation Complexity
```
Setup: 2 weeks
Development: 5-7 weeks
Deployment: 2-3 days
Total: 7-10 weeks
```

### What to Self-Host vs Cloud

```
USE CLOUD (Supabase/Vercel) FOR:
✓ Database (PostgreSQL)
✓ Authentication
✓ Main application hosting
✓ Edge functions for latency-sensitive tasks

Reasons:
- Hard to set up securely
- Requires significant DevOps knowledge
- Built-in backups, scaling, monitoring
- Not the expensive part at scale

SELF-HOST FOR:
✓ File storage (MinIO instead of Supabase Storage)
✓ OCR processing (Tesseract server)
✓ LLM processing (Ollama + Llama)
✓ Image processing (Sharp.js server)

Reasons:
- Storage costs add up quickly
- Processing can be parallelized
- No rate limits
- Predictable costs
```

## Option 4: Cloudflare Workers + D1 + R2

**Stack**: Cloudflare Workers (compute) + D1 (database) + R2 (storage)

### Architecture Diagram
```
User Browser
    ↓
Cloudflare Workers (Edge compute)
    ↓
├─> D1 (SQLite database at edge)
├─> R2 (S3-compatible storage)
└─> KV (Key-value cache)
```

### Pros
- Everything at the edge (ultra-fast)
- Free tier is VERY generous
- No cold starts
- Unlimited bandwidth (R2)
- Pay-as-you-go pricing
- Global by default

### Cons
- D1 is still in beta (as of 2025)
- 10MB max response size
- Limited to JavaScript/TypeScript
- Different mental model (not Node.js)
- Harder to run complex libraries (Tesseract)
- Less mature ecosystem

### Cost Analysis (Super Cheap!)
```
Free tier:
- Workers: 100k requests/day
- D1: 5M reads/day, 100k writes/day
- R2: 10GB storage, unlimited bandwidth

Paid tier (if you exceed free):
- Workers: $5/month + $0.50 per million requests
- D1: $5/month + usage
- R2: $0.015/GB storage (no bandwidth fees!)

Example: 1,000 users
- Workers: ~$10/month
- D1: ~$5/month
- R2: ~$15/month (1TB)
Total: ~$30/month (cheaper than Supabase Pro!)
```

### Best For
- Global applications (low latency everywhere)
- Cost-conscious developers
- JavaScript/TypeScript-only projects
- File-heavy applications (R2 has free egress)
- Developers who like cutting-edge tech

### Implementation Complexity
```
Setup: 1 week
Development: 5-7 weeks (different APIs)
Deployment: 1 day
Total: 6-8 weeks
```

### Limitations
```
CANNOT RUN:
- Tesseract.js (too heavy for Workers)
- Most Node.js libraries
- Long-running processes (> 30 seconds CPU)

WORKAROUNDS:
- Use Google Cloud Vision for OCR (paid)
- Use Cloudflare AI for LLM (beta, limited)
- Use external services for heavy processing
```

## Option 5: AWS Free Tier (Not Recommended)

**Stack**: AWS Lambda + RDS + S3 + API Gateway

### Why NOT Recommended

```
PROS:
- Powerful, enterprise-grade
- Mature ecosystem
- Lots of free tier

CONS:
- Extremely complex setup
- Easy to accidentally incur costs
- Free tier expires after 12 months
- Steep learning curve
- Vendor lock-in (worse than Supabase)
- Surprise bills are common

Free tier:
- Lambda: 1M requests/month (good)
- RDS: 750 hours/month (only t2.micro, very slow)
- S3: 5GB storage (too small)

After 12 months:
- RDS: ~$15/month minimum
- S3: $0.023/GB
- Lambda: $0.20 per million requests
Total: ~$40-100/month (more expensive than Supabase)
```

**Verdict**: Unless you're already an AWS expert, avoid this for MVP.

---

## Option 6: Firebase (Not Recommended for This Use Case)

**Stack**: Firebase (Firestore + Storage + Auth + Functions)

### Why NOT Recommended

```
PROS:
- Google-backed
- Real-time database
- Great for mobile apps
- Free tier is decent

CONS:
- NoSQL database (bad for transactions/reporting)
- Functions are slow (cold starts)
- Expensive at scale
- Limited SQL-like queries
- Storage costs add up quickly

Free tier:
- Firestore: 1GB storage, 50k reads/day
- Storage: 5GB (better than Supabase)
- Functions: 2M invocations/month

Paid tier:
- Firestore: $0.18/GB storage
- Storage: $0.026/GB (more expensive than Supabase)
- Functions: Pay-as-you-go

Example: 100 users
- Firestore: ~$20/month
- Storage: ~$30/month
- Functions: ~$10/month
Total: ~$60/month (more expensive than Supabase)
```

**Verdict**: Firestore's NoSQL model is poor fit for financial transactions. Stick with PostgreSQL.
