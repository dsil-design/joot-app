# Executive Summary: Document Management & Transaction Reconciliation System

**Project:** Joot Personal Finance Application
**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Status:** Design Complete - Ready for Development

---

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive UX design for a document management and transaction reconciliation system for Joot. This feature will enable users to upload financial documentation (receipts, statements, emails) and automatically match them to transactions, significantly reducing manual data entry and improving data accuracy.

---

## Problem Statement

**Current State:**
- Users manually enter all transactions into Joot
- No ability to attach proof/documentation to transactions
- No verification that entered data matches actual receipts
- Time-consuming and error-prone process
- Lost receipts make financial tracking incomplete

**Impact:**
- 30-45 minutes per week spent on manual entry
- 15-20% of transactions have data entry errors
- Users lose trust in their financial data
- Difficulty during tax time or expense reimbursement

---

## Solution Overview

A three-phase workflow that transforms how users manage financial documentation:

### 1. Upload & Process
- Bulk upload via drag-and-drop interface
- Mobile camera capture for quick receipt photos
- Automatic OCR and data extraction
- Support for PDFs, images, email formats

### 2. Match & Review
- AI-powered automatic matching to existing transactions
- Confidence-scored suggestions (high/medium/low)
- Side-by-side comparison interface
- Bulk approval for high-confidence matches
- Manual linking and correction capabilities

### 3. Manage & Search
- Comprehensive document library
- Advanced search and filtering
- Multi-transaction support (bank statements)
- Vendor profile enrichment
- Long-term archival and retrieval
