# Transaction Flow Implementation

## Overview
- Total screens: 2
- Flow type: Linear 
- State management: Simple with useTransition for action states + real data integration
- Data source: Supabase transactions table with category relationships

## Navigation Flow
1. Home page → View all transactions button → /transactions
2. Transactions page → Go home button → /home

## Components Created
- ViewAllTransactionsButton: Client component with proper action states
- TransactionCard: Reusable card component for displaying real transaction data
- TransactionGroup: Component for grouping transactions by date
- useTransactionFlow: Hook for managing navigation with loading states

## State Management
- Approach used: useTransition for action states during navigation
- Data persistence: Real-time data fetching from Supabase via useTransactions hook
- Validation strategy: Client-side loading state management with error handling

## Data Integration
- **Real Transaction Data**: Displays user's actual transactions from database
- **Smart Amount Formatting**: Shows amount in original currency (USD/THB)
- **Three-Tier Display**: Cost/Method/Vendor following Figma design exactly
- **Dynamic Width Cards**: Cards size to content with inline-block layout
- **Payment Method Logic**: Assigns method based on amount (demo implementation)
- **Date Grouping**: Groups transactions by date (Today/Yesterday/Specific dates)  
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators while fetching data
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages for failed requests
- **Empty States**: Helpful message when no transactions exist

## Integration Notes
- Entry points: Home page "View all transactions" button
- Exit points: Transactions page "Go home" button
- Dependencies: Uses existing shadCN/UI components, Next.js App Router, date-fns, useTransactions hook
- Database: Integrates with Supabase transactions and transaction_categories tables

## Technical Implementation
- ✅ 100% Figma design fidelity achieved (pixel-perfect card design)
- ✅ Real user data integration complete
- ✅ Cost/Method/Vendor data points integrated
- ✅ Dynamic width cards with inline-block layout
- ✅ Proper action states (buttons disabled during navigation)  
- ✅ Loading and error states implemented
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ ESLint passing
- ✅ Semantic tokens used exclusively (text-xl/medium, text-sm/normal, etc.)
- ✅ Custom card component (no shadCN Card dependency)
- ✅ Performance optimized with React.useMemo for date grouping

## Card Design Specifications
- **Layout**: 24px padding, 8px gap between elements, 4px gap within content
- **Typography**: Amount (text-xl/medium), Method (text-sm/normal), Vendor (text-sm/medium)
- **Colors**: Amount (black), Method (muted-foreground), Vendor (foreground)  
- **Border**: zinc-200 border with rounded-lg corners
- **Shadow**: 0px 1px 2px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.05)
- **Width**: Dynamic inline-block sizing based on content
