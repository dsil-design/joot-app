## Overview

This document summarizes the validation of the June 2025 import after implementing the currency tracking fix in the import script.

---

## Currency Tracking Fix

### What Was Fixed

The import script was updated to properly track the original currency for all transactions:

1. **USD Transactions:** `original_currency` field set to 'USD'
2. **THB Transactions:** `original_currency` field set to 'THB'
3. **Currency Conversion:** THB amounts converted to USD during import
4. **Data Preservation:** Both original and converted amounts stored

### Validation Results

‚úÖ **Currency tracking is working correctly:**
- 105 USD transactions with `original_currency = 'USD'` (Expected: 105)
- 85 THB transactions with `original_currency = 'THB'` (Expected: 85)
- 0 transactions with missing currency field
- 100% accuracy on currency distribution
