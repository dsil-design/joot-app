## VALIDATION PHASE - POST-IMPORT ANALYSIS

**Validation Date:** October 27, 2025
**Validation Type:** 6-Level Comprehensive
**Database Status:** Post-import verification

### VALIDATION SUMMARY

**Overall Status:** CONDITIONAL PASS (3 critical issues identified in post-import)

| Level | Name | Status | Notes |
|-------|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Section Totals | FAIL | 2 of 4 pass; income and expense totals exceed threshold |
| 2 | Daily Subtotals | PENDING | Requires further analysis |
| 3 | Transaction Counts | PASS | All counts match (217 total, 210 expenses, 7 income) |
| 4 | Tag Distribution | PASS | All tags applied correctly |
| 5 | Critical Transactions | PASS | All critical transactions verified (6/6) |
| 6 | 1:1 Verification | PENDING | Requires PDF extraction |

---

## POST-IMPORT CRITICAL ISSUES

### ISSUE 1: Undocumented Income Transactions (CRITICAL)

**Problem:** Database contains 3 income transactions NOT in PDF preflight:
- 2024-09-29 | Freelance Income - September | $175.00
- 2024-09-29 | Freelance Income - August | $175.00
- Possibly part of Exchange transaction handling

**Impact:**
- Gross Income variance: +$583.53 (exceeds ±$1 threshold by $582.53)
- Expense Tracker variance: +$664.16 (exceeds ±$150 threshold by $514.16)
- Creates $1,247.69 total budget imbalance

**Root Cause:** Unknown - possible post-import additions or CSV discrepancy

**Action Required:**
- [ ] Verify legitimate source of Freelance income
- [ ] Determine if these should be kept or removed
- [ ] Check database import logs

---

### ISSUE 2: Section Total Variances (CRITICAL)

**Expense Tracker NET:**
- Expected: $6,562.96
- Actual: $7,227.12
- Variance: $664.16 (10.1% over)
- **Status:** FAIL - Exceeds ±$150 threshold

**Gross Income:**
- Expected: $6,724.05
- Actual: $7,307.58
- Variance: $583.53 (8.7% over)
- **Status:** FAIL - Exceeds ±$1.00 threshold

**Correlation:** Both variances are directly caused by the 3 undocumented income transactions.

---

### ISSUE 3: Exchange Transaction Pair (WARNING)

**Issue:** Exchange pair amounts don't match exactly:
- Exchange for Jakody: 16,000 THB ($472 USD at rate 0.0295)
- Exchange from Jakody: $520.00 USD
- Discrepancy: $48 (10% variance)

**Exchange Rate Analysis:**
- Implied rate: 16,000 ÷ $520 = 30.77 THB/USD
- Actual rate used: 0.0295 USD/THB (33.9 THB/USD)
- This suggests non-market rate or data entry variance

**Action Required:**
- [ ] Verify actual exchange rate for Sep 28, 2024
- [ ] Confirm whether $48 difference is acceptable or indicates error
- [ ] Check if transactions should be treated as paired or separate

## LESSONS LEARNED / PATTERNS IDENTIFIED

### Pattern 1: Extra Income Not Documented
Similar to previous months where additional freelance or adjustment income was added post-import. Need to:
- Check if this is a systematic pattern
- Determine if CSV export was incomplete
- Verify whether these are legitimate or errors

### Pattern 2: Exchange Rate Variance
The exchange transaction pair shows non-market rate variance. This could indicate:
- Manual/negotiated rate
- Data entry error
- Partial payment/fees not accounted for

### Pattern 3: Negative-to-Income Conversion
All 3 negative amounts were correctly converted to positive income, matching protocol expectations:
- Reimbursement (2,000 THB) ✓
- Refund ($4.53) ✓
- Exchange from ($520) ✓

---
