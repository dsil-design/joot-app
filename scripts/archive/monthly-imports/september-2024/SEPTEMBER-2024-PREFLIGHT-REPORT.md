Expected Total = Expense Tracker NET + Florida House + Savings
Expected Total = $6,562.96 + $195.16 + $341.67
Expected Total = $7,099.79
```

**Note:** This is the total amount of money OUT (expenses + savings). Gross Income ($6,724.05) is separate.

---

## 5. DUPLICATE DETECTION

**✓ NO DUPLICATES FOUND** between Expense Tracker and Florida House sections.

The two Florida House transactions (FPL Electricity and TECO Gas) are utility bills paid from the House Account, not duplicated in the Expense Tracker.

## PARSING STRATEGY RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. Create New Parser Script
**File:** `scripts/parse-september-2024.js`
**Template:** Copy from `scripts/parse-january-2025.js`

### 2. Critical Updates Required:
1. **Update line ranges:**
   - Expense Tracker: 3977-4251 (i starts at 3976)
   - Gross Income: 4253-4262
   - Savings: 4264-4267
   - Florida House: 4279-4286

2. **Enhanced amount parsing (CRITICAL):**
```javascript
function parseAmount(amountStr) {
  if (!amountStr || amountStr.trim() === '') return 0;
  // Remove $, commas, quotes, tabs, parentheses, spaces
  let cleaned = amountStr.replace(/[$,"\t()\s]/g, '').trim();

  // Handle parentheses for negative
  const isNegative = amountStr.includes('(') && amountStr.includes(')');
  if (isNegative) {
    cleaned = '-' + cleaned.replace(/-/g, '');
  }

  return parseFloat(cleaned);
}
```

3. **Enhanced reimbursement detection (CRITICAL):**
```javascript
// Support typo variants: Reimbursement, Remibursement, Rembursement, etc.
// Support missing colon: "Reimbursement" vs "Reimbursement:"
const reimbRegex = /^Re(im|mi|m)?burs[e]?ment:?/i;
if (reimbRegex.test(description)) {
  // Exclude DSIL Design/LLC (not present in Sep 2024, but good practice)
  if (!merchant || !/(dsil|design|llc)/i.test(merchant)) {
    tags.push('Reimbursement');
    transaction_type = 'income';
    // Amount should be positive (convert negative to positive)
    amount = Math.abs(amount);
  }
}
```

4. **Negative amount handling (CRITICAL):**
```javascript
// Check if amount is negative (parentheses or minus sign)
if (amountStr.includes('(') || amountStr.includes('-')) {
  // This is income (refund, reimbursement, exchange)
  transaction_type = 'income';
  amount = Math.abs(parseAmount(amountStr));
}
```

5. **Florida House section:**
   - Column structure: `,Desc,Merchant,Payment Type,Subtotal`
   - Amount is in column 4 (not column 5 like some months)
   - Dates ARE present (no need to default to 2024-09-30)

6. **Savings section:**
   - Only 1 actual transaction (TOTAL row should be skipped)
   - Date field is EMPTY for this month (not MM/DD/YYYY format)
   - Default date to 2024-09-01 for the Emergency Savings transaction

### 3. Validation Checks:
- Total transactions: 218 (211 ET + 4 GI + 1 S + 2 FH)
- Expense Tracker NET: Should match $6,562.96 within 1.5%
- Currency distribution: ~36% THB, ~63% USD
- Tags: 1 Reimbursement, 0 BE, 2 FH, 1 S/I

### 4. User Consultation Items:
**Before proceeding with import, confirm with user:**
1. ✅ Large moving cost ($1,259.41) - one-time expense, okay to import?
2. ✅ Currency exchange transaction pair (Jakody) - both transactions should be imported?
3. ✅ All 3 negative amounts should be converted to income?

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Review this report** - Confirm all findings
2. **User consultation** - Confirm unusual transactions

4. **Test parsing** - Run parser and verify counts/totals
5. **Comprehensive validation** - Run full validation suite
6. **Review red flags** - Address all CRITICAL issues
7. **Final approval** - User approval before import
8. **Execute import** - Run production import script
