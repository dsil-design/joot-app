## RESOLUTION OF LEVEL 1 VARIANCES

### Original Level 1 Findings

**Expense Tracker NET:**
- PDF Expected: $6,562.96
- Database Calculated: $7,227.12
- Variance: $664.16 (FAIL)

**Gross Income:**
- PDF Expected: $6,724.05

- Variance: $583.53 (FAIL)

### Level 6 Resolution

The Level 6 comprehensive verification confirms:

1. **All 217 PDF transactions are in the database** (100% match)
2. **All 217 database transactions are in the PDF** (100% verification)
3. **The 2 Freelance Income transactions ARE in the PDF** (Gross Income Tracker section shows both $175 NJDA entries)
