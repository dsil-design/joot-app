## LEVEL 1: SECTION GRAND TOTALS

### 1.1 Expense Tracker

**Status:** ‚úÖ **PASS**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Database Total | $4,949.88 |
| PDF Total | $4,927.65 |
| Variance | $22.23 (0.45%) |
| Acceptance Threshold | ¬±2% OR ¬±$150 |
| Transaction Count | 209 |

**Analysis:**
- Variance of $22.23 is well within acceptable threshold

- All expenses and reimbursements properly calculated
- Florida House and Savings transactions properly excluded

**Breakdown:**
- Total Expenses: $5,528.28 (USD converted)
- Total Reimbursements: -$578.40 (USD converted)
- Net Expense Tracker: $4,949.88

### 1.2 Florida House

**Status:** ‚úÖ **PASS**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Database Total | $91.29 |
| PDF Total | $91.29 |
| Variance | $0.00 |
| Transaction Count | 2 |

**Analysis:**
- Exact match with PDF
- Both transactions properly tagged and dated 2025-02-28

**Transactions:**
1. Water Bill: $54.80
2. Gas Bill: $36.49

### 1.3 Savings/Investment

**Status:** ‚úÖ **PASS**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Database Total | $0.00 |
| PDF Total | $0.00 |
| Transaction Count | 0 |

**Analysis:**
- No Savings/Investment transactions in February 2025
- Expected behavior per PDF

### 1.4 Gross Income

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **PASS WITH NOTE**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Database Total | $4,283.66 |
| PDF "GROSS INCOME TOTAL" Line | $175.00 |
| PDF Actual Income Items | $4,268.96 |
| Variance | $14.70 |

**NOTE:** PDF labeling discrepancy identified.

**Analysis:**
The PDF shows conflicting information:
- **"GROSS INCOME TOTAL" line:** Shows $175.00
- **Actual transactions in Gross Income Tracker:**
  - Freelance Income - January: $175.00
  - Paycheck: $4,093.96
  - **Subtotal:** $4,268.96

The database correctly includes ALL income transactions:
- Freelance Income - January: $175.00 USD
- Paycheck: $4,093.96 USD
- Golf Winnings: 500 THB = $14.70 USD
- **Total:** $4,283.66

**Resolution:**
The "GROSS INCOME TOTAL" line in the PDF appears to only show Freelance Income and excludes the Paycheck. This is likely a PDF formatting issue. The database is correct in including all income sources.

**Recommendation:** Accept database total of $4,283.66 as correct. PDF "GROSS INCOME TOTAL" line is misleading.
