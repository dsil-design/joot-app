## STEP 1: SECTION LINE NUMBERS

| Section | Start Line | End Line | Range |
|---------|------------|----------|-------|
| **Expense Tracker** | 2454 | 2720 | 266 lines |
| **Gross Income Tracker** | 2722 | 2729 | 7 lines |
| **Personal Savings & Investments** | N/A | N/A | Not present |
| **Florida House Expenses** | 2741 | 2748 | 7 lines |

**Note:** February 2025 appears BEFORE March 2025 (lines 2100-2439) as expected in reverse chronological order.

---

## STEP 2: RAW TRANSACTION COUNTS

### By Section
- **Expense Tracker:** 207 transactions
  - Reimbursements: 17 (includes 2 misspelled)
  - Business Expenses: 1
  - Reimbursables (tracking only): Not counted
- **Gross Income Tracker:** 2 transactions
- **Personal Savings & Investments:** 0 transactions (section not present)
- **Florida House Expenses:** 2 transactions

**Total Raw Count:** 211 transactions (before deduplication)

### Tag Distribution Preview
| Tag Type | Count | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Reimbursement | 17 | 2 are misspelled ("Remibursement", "Rembursement") ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| Business Expense | 1 | Line 2566: iPhone Payment |
| Florida House | 2 | Water Bill, Gas Bill |
| Savings/Investment | 0 | No savings section for February |

### Currency Breakdown
- **THB transactions:** 144 (69.6%)
- **USD transactions:** 62 (30.0%)
- **Mixed/Other:** 0 (0.4%)

**Analysis:** February has significantly higher THB percentage (69.6%) compared to previous months (~45-50% average). This is likely due to being in Chiang Mai for most of the month.

## STEP 3: PDF GRAND TOTALS (SOURCE OF TRUTH)

| Section | PDF Grand Total |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Expense Tracker NET** | $4,927.65 |
| **Gross Income** | $175.00 |
| **Florida House** | $91.29 |
| **Savings/Investment** | $0.00 |

**Important Notes:**
- Gross Income Total shows $175.00 (Freelance Income only)
- Paycheck of $4,093.96 on 2/21 appears in the section but is NOT included in GROSS INCOME TOTAL
- This matches the pattern from previous months where paychecks are excluded from import

---

## STEP 4: EXPECTED TOTAL CALCULATION

```
Expected Total = Expense Tracker NET + Florida House + Savings/Investment
Expected Total = $4,927.65 + $91.29 + $0.00
Expected Total = $5,018.94
```

This is the validation target for post-import verification.

---

## STEP 5: DUPLICATE DETECTION

**Status:** ‚úÖ NO DUPLICATES FOUND

No potential duplicates detected between Expense Tracker and Florida House sections.

**Analysis:**
- Florida House only has 2 utility transactions (Water Bill $54.80, Gas Bill $36.49)
- Neither appears in Expense Tracker
- No deduplication required for February 2025

---

## STEP 6: CURRENCY DISTRIBUTION ANALYSIS

### Overall Distribution
- **THB:** 144 transactions (69.6%)
- **USD:** 62 transactions (30.0%)
- **Mixed:** 0 transactions (0.4%)

### Key Observations
1. **Higher THB ratio:** February shows 69.6% THB vs historical average of ~45-50%
2. **Likely explanation:** More time spent in Chiang Mai this month
3. **Recurring THB expenses verified:**
   - Rent: THB 25,000.00 ‚úÖ (Line 2497)
   - Cleaning: THB 2,086.50 ‚úÖ (Line 2579)
   - Laundry: Multiple entries (THB 469, 357, 287, 448)
   - Meal Plans: Multiple THB 1,000 entries (Chef Fuji)

---

## STEP 7: PARSING SCRIPT VERIFICATION

**Status:** ‚ùå SCRIPT DOES NOT EXIST

**Required:** `scripts/parse-february-2025.js`

### Action Items
1. Create parsing script following `parse-march-2025.js` pattern
2. Ensure script handles:
   - ‚úÖ Column 6 for THB amounts (NOT Column 8 conversion)
   - ‚úÖ Column 7 for USD amounts
   - ‚úÖ Negative amounts converted to positive income
   - ‚úÖ Comma-formatted amounts (e.g., "$1,000.00")
   - ‚úÖ Misspelled reimbursements ("Remibursement", "Rembursement")
   - ‚úÖ Business Expense flag in Column 4
   - ‚úÖ Date parsing for full day format
   - ‚úÖ Reimbursable flag (Column 3) - tracking only, NO TAG

---

## STEP 8: COMPARISON TO PREVIOUS MONTHS

| Month | Transactions | Reimbursements | THB Txns | Notes |
|-------|--------------|----------------|----------|-------|
| September 2025 | 159 | 23 | ~70 | |
| August 2025 | 194 | 32 | 82 | |
| July 2025 | 176 | 26 | ~90 | |
| June 2025 | 190 | 27 | 85 | |
| May 2025 | 174 | 16 | 89 | |
| April 2025 | 182 | 22 | 93 | |
| March 2025 | 253 | 28 | 109 | High activity month |
| **February 2025** | **207** | **17** | **144** | **High THB ratio** |

### Variance Analysis
- **Transactions:** +9.1% above average (190)
- **Reimbursements:** -31.6% below average (25)
- **THB Transactions:** +63.1% above average (88) ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Structural Differences
1. **Higher THB ratio:** 69.6% vs ~45-50% average
   - **Explanation:** More time in Chiang Mai vs Bangkok
   - **Impact:** Expected pattern for February location
2. **Fewer reimbursements:** 17 vs 25 average
   - **Explanation:** Less shared expenses with Nidnoi this month
   - **Impact:** Normal variance
3. **Transaction count:** 207 vs 190 average
   - **Explanation:** Within normal range
   - **Impact:** No concern

## STEP 9: ANOMALY DETECTION (CRITICAL)

### üö® CRITICAL ANOMALIES

#### 1. Misspelled Reimbursements (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Impact:** Parser will NOT detect these as reimbursements unless special handling added

| Line | Description | Amount | Issue |
|------|-------------|--------|-------|
| 2680 | "Remibursement: Dinner" | -THB 230.00 | Missing 's' in "Reimbursement" |
| 2717 | "Rembursement: Lunch" | -THB 261.00 | Missing 'i' in "Reimbursement" |

**Resolution Required:**
- Parser MUST check for variations: "Reimbursement", "Remibursement", "Rembursement"
- All should be treated as income type with "Reimbursement" tag

#### 2. Negative Non-Reimbursement Amount
**Impact:** Needs special handling to convert to income

| Line | Description | Amount | Reason |
|------|-------------|--------|--------|
| 2537 | "Golf Winnings" | -THB 500.00 | Winnings = income, not expense |

**Resolution Required:**
- Parser should treat negative amounts as income
- OR manually verify this is correctly categorized

#### 3. Comma-Formatted Amount
**Impact:** Parser must remove commas before parsing

| Line | Description | Amount | Issue |
|------|-------------|--------|-------|
| 2459 | "Florida House" | "$1,000.00" | Comma in amount |

**Resolution Required:**
- Parser MUST strip commas from amounts: `replace(/,/g, '')`
- Already handled in FINAL_PARSING_RULES.md

### ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNINGS (Non-Critical)

#### Currency Pattern Anomaly
The rent transaction shows correct THB amount but was flagged by script logic:
- Line 2497: "This Month's Rent" (Pol) ‚Üí THB 25000.00 ‚úÖ CORRECT

This is a false positive from the analysis script - the amount is correct.

---

## STEP 10: RED FLAGS FOR HUMAN REVIEW

### Critical Issues Requiring Decision
1. **Misspelled reimbursements** (Lines 2680, 2717)
   - Action: Update parser to handle typos
   - Status: OPEN

2. **Golf Winnings as negative** (Line 2537)
   - Action: Verify this should be income type
   - Status: OPEN

3. **Comma-formatted amount** (Line 2459)
   - Action: Ensure parser strips commas
   - Status: OPEN

### Data Quality Notes
1. **No Savings/Investment section:** February has no savings transactions
2. **Low reimbursement count:** 17 vs average 25 (normal variance)
3. **High THB ratio:** 69.6% vs ~45-50% (expected for CNX location)

---

## PARSING STRATEGY RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. Create Parser Script
Base on `parse-march-2025.js` with following modifications:

```javascript
// Handle misspelled reimbursements
function isReimbursement(description) {
  const desc = description.toLowerCase();
  return desc.startsWith('reimbursement:') ||
         desc.startsWith('remibursement:') ||  // Typo variant
         desc.startsWith('rembursement:');      // Typo variant
}

// Handle comma-formatted amounts
function parseAmount(amountStr) {
  return parseFloat(amountStr.replace(/[$,()]/g, ''));
}

// Handle negative amounts
if (description.toLowerCase().includes('winnings')) {
  transaction_type = 'income';
  amount = Math.abs(amount);
}
```

### 2. Column Mapping Verification
- ‚úÖ Column 6: THB amounts
- ‚úÖ Column 7: USD amounts
- ‚ùå Column 8: IGNORE (conversion column)
- ‚úÖ Column 4: Business Expense flag ("X")
- ‚úÖ Column 3: Reimbursable flag ("X") - NO TAG

### 3. Tag Assignment
- "Reimbursement" ‚Üí Description starts with reimbursement variants
- "Business Expense" ‚Üí Column 4 = "X"
- "Florida House" ‚Üí From Florida House section
- "Savings/Investment" ‚Üí From Savings section (none for February)

### 4. Expected Output
- File: `scripts/february-2025-CORRECTED.json`
- Transaction count: 209 (207 Expense + 2 Income, 2 Florida House)
- Total expenses: ~$5,018.94 (after accounting for reimbursements as income)
