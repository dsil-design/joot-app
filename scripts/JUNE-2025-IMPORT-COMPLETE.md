## Critical Bugs Fixed During Import

### Bug #1: Invalid Date Range
- **Issue:** Import script assumed all months have 31 days
- **Impact:** Caused error for June (30 days), would also fail for Feb, Apr, Sept, Nov
- **Fix:** `scripts/db/import-month.js:236-238` - Now calculates correct last day dynamically
- **Prevention:** Will work correctly for all months going forward

### Bug #2: Currency Tracking Not Working
- **Issue:** Import script used `txn.currency` instead of `txn.original_currency`
- **Impact:** All 190 transactions were imported as USD, losing THB currency tracking
- **Fix:** `scripts/db/import-month.js:320` - Now checks `original_currency` first
- **Resolution:** Deleted and re-imported all 190 transactions with correct currency tracking

## Next Steps

**Available for Import:**
- May 2025 ‚Üê **NEXT**
- April 2025
- March 2025
- February 2025
- January 2025
- December 2024 and earlier

**Recommendations:**
1. Continue with May 2025 using the established protocol
2. Watch for new currencies as we go back in time (VND, MYR, CNY support already added)
3. The two bug fixes will prevent date and currency issues in future months
4. Consider adding post-import tag verification to catch missing tags earlier

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always validate currency distribution** - The first import missed THB tracking entirely
2. **Month-end dates vary** - Not all months have 31 days (June has 30)
3. **Perfect variance is achievable** - Second 0% variance month proves data quality
4. **Tag automation has limits** - Some tags require manual application or improved logic
5. **Pre-flight analysis is critical** - Caught structural issues before import
