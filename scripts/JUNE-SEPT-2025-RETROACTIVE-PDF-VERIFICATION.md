# June-September 2025 Retroactive PDF Verification Report

**Date:** October 23, 2025
**User:** dennis@dsil.design (ID: a1c3caff-a5de-4898-be7d-ab4b76247ae6)
**Purpose:** Verify previously imported months (June-September 2025) against source PDFs
**Status:** ❌ **CRITICAL DATA INTEGRITY ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

---

## Executive Summary

### 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE: THB AMOUNTS NOT CONVERTED TO USD

All four months (June-September 2025) have been imported with **THB amounts stored as raw THB values instead of converted USD values**. This causes massive inflation in expense totals:

- **THB transactions are 32.5x larger than they should be**
- Example: THB 35,000 rent is stored as **$35,000** instead of **~$1,077 USD**
- **ALL months FAIL verification** with variances ranging from 12.64% to 896.41%
- **Immediate corrective action required** before continuing imports

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem

The import process is failing to convert THB amounts to USD:

**In the PDF:**
```
This Month's Rent    Landlord    Bangkok Bank Account    THB 35000.00    $1074.50    $1074.50
```

**In the Database:**
```javascript
{
  description: "This Month's Rent",
  original_currency: "THB",
  amount: 35000,  // ❌ Should be 1074.50
  original_amount: null
}
```

**Should Be:**
```javascript
{
  description: "This Month's Rent",
  original_currency: "THB",
  amount: 1074.50,  // ✅ Converted USD amount
  original_amount: 35000  // Original THB amount
}
```

### Evidence

**Every single THB transaction** across all four months shows a 32.50x ratio between stored amount and expected USD amount:

| Transaction | THB Amount | Stored as | Should be | Ratio |
|-------------|------------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Rent (Aug) | 35,000 | $35,000 | $1,076.92 | 32.50x |
| Golf (Aug) | 9,350 | $9,350 | $287.69 | 32.50x |
| Rent (Jun) | 35,000 | $1,074.50 | $1,074.50 | 1.00x ✅ |

**Wait - June shows correct conversion!** Let me investigate if this changed between months...

### Additional Finding

Looking at the data more carefully:
- **June 2025:** Rent stored as $1,074.50 (CORRECT - properly converted)
- **August 2025:** Rent stored as $35,000 (WRONG - not converted)

**This suggests the conversion logic broke or changed between June and August imports.**

2. Cleaning: THB 3,222 → Stored as $98.92 ✅ CORRECT
3. Visa Fee: THB 5,875 → Stored as $180.36 ✅ CORRECT
```

**June appears to have CORRECT THB conversion, but still fails due to other discrepancies (likely duplicate handling or rounding).**

### August 2025 🚨 CRITICAL FAILURE

#### PDF Totals (Source: page3.pdf)
- **Expense Tracker:** $8,025.57
- **Florida House:** $163.60
- **TOTAL EXPENSES:** $8,189.17
- **Gross Income:** $175.00 (estimated, but $0.00 actual per PDF)
- **Personal Savings:** $341.67

#### Database Totals
- **Total Transactions:** 194
- **Total Expenses:** $81,597.36 **← 10x TOO HIGH!**
- **Total Income:** $24,291.09 **← MASSIVELY INFLATED**
  - Reimbursements: $24,116.09
  - Non-Reimbursement Income: $175.00 ✅
- **THB Transactions:** 82
- **USD Transactions:** 112

#### Variance Analysis
- **Expense Variance:** +$73,408.19 (+896.41%) **← CATASTROPHIC**
- **Income Variance:** $0.00 (0.00%) ✅
- **Status:** ❌ **CRITICAL FAIL**

#### Sample THB Transaction Check
```
1. Rent: THB 35,000 → Stored as $35,000 ❌ NOT CONVERTED! (should be ~$1,077)
2. Golf: THB 9,350 → Stored as $9,350 ❌ NOT CONVERTED! (should be ~$288)
3. Electricity: THB 4,677.36 → Stored as $4,677.36 ❌ NOT CONVERTED! (should be ~$144)
4. Cleaning: THB 2,782 → Stored as $2,782 ❌ NOT CONVERTED! (should be ~$86)
```

**EVERY SINGLE THB TRANSACTION IS UNCONVERTED - THIS IS THE ROOT CAUSE!**

The correct income total ($175 non-reimbursement) suggests income transactions may have been handled correctly, but expenses are catastrophically wrong.

## Key Findings

### 1. THB Conversion Broke Between July and August 2025

- **June & July:** THB amounts properly converted to USD ✅
- **August & September:** THB amounts stored as raw THB values ❌

**Something changed in the import process between these months!**

### 2. June & July Still Fail Despite Correct Conversion

Even with proper THB conversion, June and July show 12-14% variance. Possible causes:
- Duplicate transaction handling
- Zero-amount transaction exclusion
- Rounding differences in exchange rates
- Missing or extra transactions

### 3. Reimbursements Are Correctly Classified

Reimbursements are properly stored as income (money received back from others). This is working as designed.

### 4. Transaction Counts Match

| Month | Expected | Actual | Match |
|-------|----------|--------|-------|
| June | ~190 | 190 | ✅ |
| July | ~177 | 177 | ✅ |
| August | ~194 | 194 | ✅ |
| September | ~159 | 159 | ✅ |

All transactions were imported - the issue is purely with **currency conversion**, not missing data.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **🚨 HALT ALL NEW IMPORTS** until THB conversion is fixed

2. **Investigate What Changed**
   - Compare parsing scripts used for June/July vs August/September
   - Check if different JSON files were used
   - Look for code changes in the import logic between July 23 and August 1

3. **Fix August & September (Option A - RECOMMENDED)**
   - Delete August and September 2025 transactions
   - Fix the THB conversion logic in the parsing script
   - Re-import corrected JSON files
   - Verify against PDFs

4. **Fix August & September (Option B - Database Migration)**
   ```sql
   UPDATE transactions
   SET amount = amount / 32.5,  -- Use actual exchange rate
       original_amount = amount
   WHERE user_id = 'a1c3caff-a5de-4898-be7d-ab4b76247ae6'
   AND original_currency = 'THB'
   AND transaction_date >= '2025-08-01'
   AND transaction_date < '2025-10-01';
   ```
   **Risk:** This assumes a fixed 32.5 rate, but PDFs show variable rates

5. **Investigate June & July Variance**
   - 12-14% variance is significant even with correct conversion
   - Possible causes to investigate:
     - Duplicate Florida House expenses (marked as "Pending" in PDF)
     - Zero-amount transactions excluded
     - Savings transactions classification
     - Exchange rate precision/rounding

### Validation Checklist for Future Imports

Add these checks to the import protocol:

- ✅ **THB Conversion Check:**
  - Query largest THB transaction
  - Verify amount is in USD range (not THB range)
  - Example: THB 35,000 rent should be ~$1,000-1,100, not $35,000

- ✅ **Spot Check First 5 THB Transactions:**
  - Compare PDF amount vs DB amount
  - Verify conversion rate is reasonable (28-35 THB = $1 USD)

- ✅ **Total Variance Check:**
  - Run verification script immediately after import
  - Must be within ±3% of PDF total
  - If >3%, investigate before proceeding

### Parsing Logic Review

The parsing script should:
1. Extract the "Conversion (THB to USD)" column value
2. Store this converted USD value in `amount`
3. Store the original THB value in `original_amount`
4. Store "THB" in `original_currency`

**Example from PDF:**
```
This Month's Rent | Landlord | Bangkok Bank Account | THB 35000.00 | $1074.50 | $1074.50
                                                        ↑              ↑
                                                    original       converted
                                                                (store this!)
```
