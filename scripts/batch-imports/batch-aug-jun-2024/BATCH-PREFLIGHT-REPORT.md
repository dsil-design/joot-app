## BATCH STRATEGY & AUTO-PROCEED CRITERIA

### Recommended Processing Order

**Recommendation:** Process in chronological order (June ‚Üí July ‚Üí August)

**Rationale:**
1. June is simplest (USA month, low THB%, fewer transactions)
2. July is most complex (moving expenses, many reimbursable items)
3. August is moderate (settled in Thailand)

### Auto-Proceed vs Pause Criteria

#### PROCEED AUTOMATICALLY IF:
- ‚úÖ All PDF totals match expected ranges (¬±2%)
- ‚úÖ Transaction counts within ¬±5% of estimates
- ‚úÖ Only standard red flags (negative amounts, comma formatting)
- ‚úÖ All recurring expenses present
- ‚úÖ No new unusual patterns

#### PAUSE FOR USER REVIEW IF:
- ‚ùå New CRITICAL red flags appear beyond standard patterns
- ‚ùå Transaction count variance >5%
- ‚ùå Missing expected recurring expenses
- ‚ùå Unusual transactions requiring context
- ‚ùå Currency patterns deviate >20% from trend
- ‚ùå Validation failures

### Gate 2 Phase-by-Phase Strategy

#### June 2024 Strategy:
- **Phase 1 Pre-Flight:** AUTO-PROCEED (simple USA month)
- **Phase 2 Parse:** PAUSE (verify Column 3 vs 4, typo reimbursement, negative amounts)
- **Phase 3 Import:** AUTO-PROCEED (if parsing successful)
- **Phase 4 Validate:** PAUSE (verify all large flight purchases correct)

#### July 2024 Strategy:
- **Phase 1 Pre-Flight:** PAUSE (complex month - moving, many "X" in Column 3)
- **Phase 2 Parse:** PAUSE (verify all reimbursable items, large UBox charges, potential duplicates)
- **Phase 3 Import:** PAUSE (Florida House duplicate risk, homeowner's insurance in multiple sections)
- **Phase 4 Validate:** PAUSE (highest spending month, many large transactions)

#### August 2024 Strategy:
- **Phase 1 Pre-Flight:** AUTO-PROCEED (standard Thailand month)
- **Phase 2 Parse:** PAUSE (VND currency column confusion, zero-dollar transaction, comma amount)
- **Phase 3 Import:** AUTO-PROCEED (if parsing successful)
- **Phase 4 Validate:** AUTO-PROCEED (if import successful)

### Estimated Time to Complete

**Gate 1 (This Report):** 45 minutes ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Gate 2 Month 1 (June):** 60-80 minutes (4 phases √ó ~15-20 min)
**Gate 2 Month 2 (July):** 80-100 minutes (complex month, many pauses)
**Gate 2 Month 3 (August):** 60-80 minutes (4 phases √ó ~15-20 min)
**Gate 3 (Batch Validation):** 30 minutes

**Total Estimated Time:** 4.5-6 hours spread across user review sessions

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### PROCEED to Gate 2 with following CRITICAL awareness:

1. **Column 3 vs Column 4 Confusion (June & July)**
   - Many transactions marked "X" in Column 3 (Reimbursable - NO TAG)
   - MUST verify Column 4 for actual Business Expense tags
   - Risk: Incorrectly applying tags to Column 3 items

2. **Negative Amount Conversions (All Months)**
   - 6 total negative amounts across 3 months
   - ALL must be converted to positive income
   - Parser MUST handle this automatically

3. **July Complexity**
   - Highest spending month ($11,057)
   - Moving expenses, insurance, multiple large charges
   - Florida House section present
   - Potential duplicate: Homeowner's insurance in Florida House AND gross income reimbursement
   - RECOMMEND: Extra validation attention for July

4. **Typo Detection**
   - June has "Reimbusement" typo
   - Flexible regex MUST handle: `/^Re(im|mi|m)?burs[e]?ment:?/i`

5. **VND Currency Column (August)**
   - Unexpected VND column in August CSV
   - One transaction shows THB 55,000 with $0.00 in conversions
   - MUST investigate before parsing

6. **Zero-Dollar Transactions**
   - August has "Partial Refund: Breakfast" $0.00
   - MUST be skipped per October 2024 lesson

7. **Comma-Formatted Amount**
   - August has "$1,000.00" (Florida House transfer)
   - Parser MUST handle comma cleaning

### BLOCKING ISSUES REQUIRING USER CONFIRMATION:

1. **July: Verify Homeowner's Insurance not duplicate**
   - Florida House: $1,461.00
   - Gross Income reimbursement "Me": $4,580.41 (includes insurance)
   - **USER: Please confirm these are separate transactions**

2. **July: Verify two CNX Internet charges**
   - July 10: $20.62
   - July 22: $20.78
   - **USER: Are these both legitimate or duplicate?**

3. **June: Verify Planet Fitness gym fee in CSV**
   - PDF shows $10.00 on June 17
   - **USER: Does CSV have this transaction?**

4. **August: Explain VND currency column**
   - What is VND column for?
   - Is THB 55,000 coffee transaction an error?
   - **USER: Please clarify VND usage**

### SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR GATE 2:

- ‚úÖ All 6 negative amounts converted to positive income
- ‚úÖ Typo reimbursement "Reimbusement" detected and tagged
- ‚úÖ Comma amount "$1,000.00" parsed correctly as 1000.00
- ‚úÖ Zero-dollar transaction skipped
- ‚úÖ Column 3 "X" does NOT create tags
- ‚úÖ Column 4 "X" DOES create Business Expense tags
- ‚úÖ All recurring expenses imported
- ‚úÖ Florida House section handled correctly (July only)
- ‚úÖ No duplicate transactions created
- ‚úÖ All validation levels pass for each month
