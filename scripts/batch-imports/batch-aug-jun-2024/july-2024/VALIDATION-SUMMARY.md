## Red Flags Resolved

**From Gate 1 (all resolved):**
1. ✅ RF-JUL-001: Partial Refund $(1.39) - Converted to positive income
2. ✅ RF-JUL-002: Kyle Martin "Reimbusement" - **Actually in JUNE 2024, not July**
3. ✅ RF-JUL-003: Friends Drinks -THB 750 - Converted to positive income
4. ✅ RF-JUL-004: Florida House insurance vs Gross Income reimbursement - User confirmed SEPARATE, both imported
5. ✅ RF-JUL-005: Two CNX Internet charges - User confirmed BOTH valid, both imported
6. ✅ RF-JUL-006: Column 3/4 confusion - Parser correctly applies tags only to Column 4 "X"

**No new red flags discovered during import.**

## Lessons Applied

**From 15 Previous Months:**
1. ✅ Currency handling: THB from Column 6 (not Column 8 conversion)
2. ✅ Negative amounts: Convert to positive income (database constraint)
3. ✅ Comma-formatted amounts: Enhanced parseAmount() function
4. ✅ Typo reimbursement detection: Flexible regex (though none in July - Kyle Martin was June)
5. ✅ DSIL Design exclusion: Check merchant before applying Reimbursement tag
6. ✅ Florida House dates: Default to transaction date if missing
7. ✅ Column 3 vs Column 4: Only Column 4 "X" gets Business Expense tag
8. ✅ Preserve descriptions: All descriptions imported exactly as-is
9. ✅ Reimbursement tags in Gross Income: Added tag logic to income section
