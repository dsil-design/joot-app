## Lessons Learned

### What Worked
1. ✅ Reverse chronological processing (most recent first)
2. ✅ Comprehensive deduplication detection
3. ✅ Payment method schema validation before import
4. ✅ Per-month verification before moving to next month
5. ✅ Handling identical transactions (Golf Reservation case)

### Issues Encountered & Resolved
1. **Payment Method Schema** - Sort_order field required, icon/color fields don't exist
   - Solution: Updated getOrCreatePaymentMethod with correct schema
2. **Duplicate Detection Logic** - Missing merchant in deduplication key
   - Impact: Removed 1 legitimate Golf Reservation initially
   - Solution: Manually restored, improved key generation
3. **First Import Partial Failure** - 16 transactions imported before payment method error
   - Solution: Created cleanup script, removed 19 duplicates
4. **Identical Transactions** - Two Golf Reservations with same date, amount, merchant
   - Solution: Recognized as legitimate duplicates, both imported

## Data Quality Metrics

- **Import Success Rate:** 100% (451/451)
- **Tag Accuracy:** 100% match with expected counts
- **Rent Verification:** 3/3 months confirmed
- **Currency Accuracy:** All amounts and currencies verified
- **Zero Duplicates:** Final database state clean

## Protocol Enhancements Applied (v1.1)

- ✅ Cross-month subscription verification

## Conclusion
