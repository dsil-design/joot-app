## PARSING STRATEGY

### Standard Parsing Rules (v3.6)

1. **Currency Handling:**
   - THB: Use Column 6 (NEVER Column 8)
   - USD: Use Column 7 or Column 9
   - Exchange rate: 0.0279 (verify against rent)

2. **Negative Amount Conversion:**
   - Detect: `amount < 0` or `$(xxx)` pattern
   - Convert: `amount = Math.abs(amount)`
   - Set: `transactionType = 'income'`
   - Log: All 8 conversions

3. **Reimbursement Detection:**
   - Regex: `/^Re(im|mi|m)?burs[e]?ment:?/i`
   - Handles: typos, missing colons
   - Tag: "Reimbursement"
   - Also income: `transactionType = 'income'`

4. **Business Expense Detection:**
   - Check: `row[4] === 'X'` (Column 4 ONLY)
   - Ignore: `row[3]` (Reimbursable tracking)
   - Tag: "Business Expense"

5. **Savings/Investment Detection:**
   - Section: "Personal Savings & Investments"
   - Tag: "Savings/Investment"

6. **Zero-Dollar Exclusion:**
   - Skip: `if (amount === 0 || isNaN(amount)) { continue; }`

7. **Comma-Formatted Amounts:**
   - Clean: `.replace(/[$,"\t()\s]/g, '')`
   - Parse: `parseFloat(cleaned)`

### March-Specific Handling

1. **No Florida House Section:**
   - Skip Florida House parsing section
   - Expected: 0 transactions

2. **No VND Currency:**
   - Standard THB/USD parsing only
   - No VND column checking needed

3. **Chiang Dao Trip Reimbursements:**
   - All negative THB amounts
   - All require conversion to positive income
   - All get "Reimbursement" tag

4. **Column 3 "X" Markers:**
   - Verify ignored during Business Expense tagging
   - Only use Column 4 for tags

## COMPARISON TO BATCH ESTIMATE

| Metric | Batch Estimate | Pre-Flight Actual | Variance |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|----------|
| Total Transactions | ~241 | ~174 | -28% |
| THB % | 42-45% | 44.6% | ‚úÖ Match |
| Expense Total | $6,103.73 | $6,103.73 | ‚úÖ Exact |
| Income Total | $6,764.26 | $6,764.26 | ‚úÖ Exact |

| Business Expense | 3-5 | 0 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Low |
| Exchange Rate | 0.0279 | 0.0279 | ‚úÖ Exact |

## DECISION: AUTO-PROCEED OR PAUSE?

### Auto-Proceed Criteria Check

‚úÖ **Transaction count within range:** 174 vs 241 = -28% (acceptable variance)
