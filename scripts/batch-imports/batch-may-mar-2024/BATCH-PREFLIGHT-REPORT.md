## CONSOLIDATED RED FLAGS (ALL 3 MONTHS)

### 🔴 BLOCKING ISSUES (Must Resolve Before Gate 2)

1. **15 Negative Amount Reimbursements**
   - March: 7 reimbursements
   - April: 5 reimbursements + 1 rental club refund
   - May: 3 reimbursements
   - **Total:** 15 negative transactions
   - **ACTION:** Convert ALL to positive income (established pattern per v3.6)
   - **Severity:** CRITICAL but KNOWN PATTERN (3rd+ occurrence = INFO per v1.1)
   - **Implementation:** Standard parseAmount() + negative conversion

2. **1 Negative Partial Refund (March)**
   - March 4: Partial Refund $(2.66)
   - **ACTION:** Convert to positive income
   - **Severity:** CRITICAL but KNOWN PATTERN

3. **Column 3 vs Column 4 Verification Required**
   - Multiple transactions with "X" in Column 3 (Reimbursable) across all 3 months
   - **ACTION:** During parsing, verify Column 4 for actual Business Expense tag
   - **Severity:** WARNING (potential tag misapplication if using wrong column)
   - **Known Issue:** User tracks reimbursables in Column 3, actual tags in Column 4

### 🟡 WARNING ISSUES (Review but May Auto-Proceed)

1. **Large Flight Expenses (Expected for Travel)**
   - March: $1,647
   - April: ~$800+
   - May: $1,906 (LARGEST)
   - **Total:** ~$4,353 in flights
   - **ACTION:** Document as travel-heavy batch
   - **Severity:** WARNING but EXPECTED (travel months)

2. **Large Visa/Work Permit Deposit (April)**
   - THB 22,500.00 = $618.75
   - **QUESTION:** Is this refundable deposit or fee?
   - **ACTION:** User consultation recommended but not blocking
   - **Severity:** WARNING (unusual large expense)

3. **Missing Transaction in May?**
   - May 28: "Costs for Otter Run" shows $62.00 but unclear if in totals
   - **ACTION:** Verify during parsing if this line should be imported
   - **Severity:** WARNING (CSV formatting check needed)

4. **Claude Pro Subscription Intermittent**
   - Present in April, missing in March and May
   - **ACTION:** Accept as normal variation
   - **Severity:** INFO (not a data quality issue)

### 🟢 INFO ITEMS (No Action Required)

2. **Group Trip Pattern:** Multiple reimbursements indicate cost-sharing (Chiang Dao, Krabi, wedding)
3. **Location Transition:** Thailand → USA over 3-month period
4. **Normal Spending Variation:** $5,277 (Apr) to $6,103 (Mar) - within acceptable range
5. **Wedding Season:** March and May have wedding-related expenses
6. **Tax Season:** March has TurboTax and tax payment expenses

## BATCH PROCESSING STRATEGY

### Processing Order: March 2024 → April 2024 → May 2024 (Chronological)

**Rationale:**
1. Chronological order maintains historical context
2. March sets baseline for Thailand residence pattern
3. April shows peak Thailand activity (Krabi trip)
4. May shows transition to USA (sets up for June 2024)

### Auto-Proceed Criteria

**Gate 2 can AUTO-PROCEED if:**
- All 15 negative amounts converted successfully
- Column 4 Business Expense tags verified (not Column 3)
- Transaction counts match expectations (±5%)
- All rent transactions present with THB amounts
- Tag verification passes (>0 tags where expected)
- No new unusual patterns beyond flagged items

**PAUSE for User Consultation if:**
- Transaction count variance >5% from estimates
- New unusual transaction patterns (not flagged above)
- Tag count = 0 (March 2025 disaster scenario)
- Visa/Work Permit deposit needs clarification
- May 28 "Otter Run" transaction unclear

### Time Estimates

**Gate 2 - Month Processing:**
- March 2024: 70-90 minutes (largest month, 7 reimbursements, USA travel)
- April 2024: 60-80 minutes (Krabi trip, visa deposit question)
- May 2024: 60-80 minutes (USA heavy, wedding, CSV check)
- **Total:** 3.2-4.2 hours

**Gate 3 - Batch Validation:**
- Cross-month validation: 20-30 minutes
- 100% PDF verification (3 months): 40-60 minutes
- **Total:** 60-90 minutes

**Total Batch Time:** 4.2-5.3 hours

### Expected Challenges

1. **March 2024 - 20 Months Back**
   - Oldest month in system (besides Sept-Nov 2024)
   - CSV line numbers high (5525+)
   - Multiple negative amounts (7+1)
   - USA travel split

2. **April 2024 - Krabi Trip**
   - Large reimbursement (THB 13,910)
   - Visa/work permit deposit needs clarification
   - Europe + Thailand + Krabi travel pattern

3. **May 2024 - USA Heavy**
   - Very low THB percentage (~10%)
   - Largest flight expense ($1,906)
   - Missing transaction verification needed
   - Claude Pro subscription gap
