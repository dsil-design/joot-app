## 🚨 RED FLAGS & CORRECTIONS

### 1. December 2022 Date Typos (CRITICAL)
**Issue:** 3 CSV transactions had year 2023 instead of 2022
**Impact:** Without correction, would have been 98.1% match (152/155)
**Solution:** Parser-level automatic date correction
**Result:** 100% verification achieved

**Details:**
- CSV Line 9520: Dec 14, 2023 → Dec 14, 2022 (Paycheck $2,978.94)
- CSV Line 9531: Dec 30, 2023 → Dec 30, 2022 (Casino Winnings $400)
- CSV Line 9532: Dec 30, 2023 → Dec 30, 2022 (Cruise Reimbursement $400)

### 2. Zero-Value Transactions
**Issue:** 333 zero-value transactions across Oct/Sep (198 + 135)
**Impact:** Skipped during parsing (policy: ignore $0.00 transactions)
**Solution:** Automatic skip with logging
**Result:** No data quality impact

### 3. Negative Conversions
**Total:** 5 across all months (3 December + 2 November)
**Handling:** Automatic conversion to positive income
**Result:** All handled correctly

---

### Verification Scripts
- `verify-december-1to1.js` - Protocol v2.0 verification for December
- `verify-november-1to1.js` - Protocol v2.0 verification for November
- October & September: Quick-verified with inline scripts (100% match confirmed)

---

## 🎓 KEY LEARNINGS

### 1. CSV Data Quality Varies by Month
- December 2022 had date entry errors (2023 vs 2022)
- October/September had many zero-value transactions
- Parser-level corrections are effective and auditable

### 2. Location Patterns Detectable via Currency
- 100% USD = USA residence
- 79% THB = Primarily Thailand
- 50/50 split = True dual residence
- Currency distribution is a reliable indicator of location

### 3. Protocol v2.0 Catches Everything
- Date typos detected immediately (98.1% match → investigation)
- Without 1:1 matching, 3 transactions would have been lost
- Count verification alone is insufficient

### 4. Parser Flexibility is Critical
- Date correction logic prevented data loss
- Negative amount handling works consistently
- Zero-value skip policy prevents noise

### Verification Methodology

1. **PDF Source Extraction:** Manually extracted all transactions from PDF pages 35-38
2. **Transaction-Level Matching:** Matched date, amount, currency, and transaction type
3. **1:1 Verification:** Each PDF transaction matched to exactly one database transaction
4. **Zero Tolerance:** Required 100% match rate for completion
