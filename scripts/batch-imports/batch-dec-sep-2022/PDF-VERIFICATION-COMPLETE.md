## ✅ VERIFICATION METHODOLOGY

### Protocol v2.0: 1:1 Transaction Matching

Each transaction was matched using the following criteria:

1. **Date Match:** Exact transaction date match
2. **Amount Match:** Within 0.01 tolerance for floating-point precision
3. **Currency Match:** Exact currency match (USD or THB)
4. **Transaction Type Match:** Expense vs. Income type match
5. **Unique Matching:** Each PDF transaction matched to exactly one DB transaction

### Verification Process

For each month:
1. ✅ Manually extracted all transactions from PDF source document
2. ✅ Created verification script with hardcoded PDF transactions
3. ✅ Queried database for all transactions in the target month
4. ✅ Performed 1:1 matching using Protocol v2.0 criteria
5. ✅ Identified and documented any unmatched transactions
6. ✅ Verified 100% match rate before proceeding

### What Was NOT Verified

In accordance with user instructions:
- ❌ PDF aggregate totals (GRAND TOTAL) - uses different exchange rates
- ❌ PDF daily subtotals - uses different exchange rates
- ❌ PDF currency conversion calculations - unreliable

**Verification Standard:** Transaction-level 1:1 matching only
