## WHAT IS PROTOCOL v2.0?

### The Problem with Old Verification
Previous batches (May-Dec 2023) were verified using:
- ❌ Aggregate total reconciliation (PDF GRAND TOTAL)
- ❌ Gate 3 count verification only
- ❌ Spot-checking sample transactions

**This approach is insufficient because:**
- CSV conversion formulas are broken (THB 19,000 → $0.55)
- Aggregate totals unreliable
- Missing transactions not detected
- Field accuracy not verified

### Protocol v2.0 Solution
**1:1 transaction-level matching** verifies:
1. ✅ Every CSV transaction present in database
2. ✅ Date match (exact)
3. ✅ Amount match (original currency)
4. ✅ Currency match
5. ✅ Description match
6. ✅ Vendor/merchant mapped
7. ✅ Payment method mapped
8. ✅ Transaction type correct

**Result:** 100% confidence in data accuracy

## VERIFICATION PLAN

### Phase 1: May-August 2023 (Batch 1 Verification)
**Priority:** HIGH (older data, more risk)

Create 1:1 verification scripts:
- [ ] `verify-may-1to1.js`
- [ ] `verify-june-1to1.js`
- [ ] `verify-july-1to1.js`
- [ ] `verify-august-1to1.js`

**Expected Outcome:** 662 transactions verified (90+192+192+188)

### Phase 2: September-November 2023
Create 1:1 verification scripts:
- [ ] `verify-september-1to1.js`
- [ ] `verify-october-1to1.js`
- [ ] `verify-november-1to1.js`

**Expected Outcome:** 367 transactions verified (178+114+75)

### Phase 3: December 2023
Create 1:1 verification script:
- [ ] `verify-december-1to1.js`

**Expected Outcome:** 82 transactions verified

## TOTAL 2023 VERIFICATION STATUS

### Current
- **Verified (v2.0):** 725/2,036 (35.6%)
- **Not Verified (v2.0):** 1,111/2,036 (54.6%)
- **Total:** 2,036 transactions

### After Completion
- **Verified (v2.0):** 2,036/2,036 (100%) ✅
- **All 12 months:** Jan-Dec 2023
- **Full confidence:** Every transaction 1:1 verified

---

## VERIFICATION SCRIPT TEMPLATE

Each script follows the same pattern:
```javascript
// Load CSV CORRECTED.json (source of truth)
// Query database for month
// Match each CSV transaction to DB transaction
// Report: matched, unmatched CSV, unmatched DB
// Status: VERIFIED / NEEDS REVIEW / FAILED
```

**Template:** Copy from `batch-apr-jan-2023/verify-january-1to1.js`

---

## WHY THIS MATTERS

### Risk Without v2.0 Verification
- Missing transactions not detected
- Wrong amounts not caught
- Currency errors not found
- Vendor mapping issues not identified
- Payment method errors not caught

### Confidence With v2.0 Verification
- ✅ 100% transaction presence guaranteed
- ✅ All fields verified accurate
- ✅ No missing data
- ✅ Production-ready quality

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Start with May 2023** (oldest unverified month)
2. Create verify-may-1to1.js
3. Run verification
4. Fix any issues found
5. Move to June 2023
6. Continue through December 2023

**Goal:** All of 2023 verified with Protocol v2.0 by end of session

---

## EXPECTED TIMELINE

- May-August (4 months): ~2 hours
- September-November (3 months): ~1.5 hours
- December (1 month): ~30 minutes

**Total:** ~4 hours to verify all remaining 2023 months

---

**Status:** In Progress
**Current Focus:** May 2023 verification
**Target:** 100% 2023 verification complete
