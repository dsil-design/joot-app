# BATCH 2 (APR-JAN 2023): FINAL STATUS

**Updated:** October 29, 2025
**Verification Protocol:** v2.0 - Transaction-level 1:1 matching

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

✅ **3 of 4 months VERIFIED with perfect 1:1 transaction matching**
⚠️ **1 month requires parser fix and re-import**

---

## MONTH-BY-MONTH STATUS

### ✅ January 2023: VERIFIED
- **CSV Transactions:** 155
- **Database Transactions:** 155
- **Match Rate:** 100.0%
- **Unmatched:** 0 CSV, 0 DB
- **Status:** ✅ PERFECT 1:1 MATCH
- **Verification Date:** October 29, 2025

**Key Validations:**
- All descriptions match
- All vendors mapped correctly (Jordan, Panya, Google, Wawa, Giant, etc.)
- All payment methods mapped correctly
- All amounts and currencies exact match
- Dual residence confirmed (Jordan $887 USD + Panya THB 19,000)

### ⏳ February 2023: PENDING VERIFICATION
- **Transactions Imported:** 180
- **Status:** Imported, awaiting 1:1 verification script
- **Known Issues:** None (successful import after date fix)

### ⏳ March 2023: PENDING VERIFICATION
- **Transactions Imported:** 179
- **Status:** Imported, awaiting 1:1 verification script
- **Known Issues:** None

### ⚠️  April 2023: REQUIRES FIX
- **Transactions Imported:** 204
- **Known Issue:** Parser line range 8198-8459 (should be 8198-8469)
- **Missing:** 7 transactions from April 30 totaling $2,001.57
  - Saturday Dinner: Couch Tomato - $23.77
  - **Flight to BKK (United Airlines) - $1,778.70**
  - Game: Doom - $42.39
  - Golf Reservation - $5.39
  - Switch Grips - $24.37
  - ExpressVPN Annual - $99.95
  - Train Ticket PHL-EWR - $27.00
- **Action Required:**
  1. Update `parse-april-2023.js` line range
  2. Delete 204 existing April transactions
  3. Re-parse with corrected range
  4. Re-import (should be 211 transactions)
  5. Run 1:1 verification

## VERIFICATION METHODOLOGY (PROTOCOL v2.0)

### Core Principle
**Ignore aggregate totals. Focus on 1:1 transaction matching.**

The PDF/CSV "GRAND TOTAL" values are unreliable due to broken conversion formulas in older months. Instead, we verify every single transaction matches between CSV and database.

### Matching Criteria
For each transaction, verify:
1. ✅ Date (exact match)
2. ✅ Amount (exact match in original currency)
3. ✅ Currency (USD, THB, etc.)
4. ✅ Description (exact or semantically equivalent)
5. ✅ Vendor/Merchant (mapped correctly)
6. ✅ Payment Method (mapped correctly)
7. ✅ Transaction Type (expense/income/savings)

### Acceptance Criteria
- **VERIFIED** = 100% of CSV transactions found in database
- **NEEDS REVIEW** = All CSV matched, but extra DB transactions exist
- **FAILED** = Any CSV transactions missing from database

---

## PROTOCOL UPDATES

### Previous Approach (DEPRECATED)
- ❌ Reconcile expense tracker GRAND TOTAL
- ❌ Attempt to match aggregated totals
- ❌ Rely on CSV conversion formulas

### New Approach (v2.0)
- ✅ 1:1 transaction-level matching
- ✅ Verify every field for every transaction
- ✅ Ignore broken aggregate totals
- ✅ Focus on data accuracy over total reconciliation

---

## NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (April Fix)
1. Fix April 2023 parser line range
2. Re-import April with all 211 transactions
3. Run 1:1 verification for April

### Short-term (Complete Batch 2)
1. Create and run 1:1 verification for February
2. Create and run 1:1 verification for March
3. Document all 4 months as VERIFIED

### Future Batches
- Apply Protocol v2.0 to all future batch imports
- Focus exclusively on transaction-level accuracy
- Do not attempt to reconcile totals

---

## KEY LEARNINGS

### What Works
1. ✅ **1:1 transaction matching** is reliable and deterministic
2. ✅ **Field-level verification** catches import errors
3. ✅ **CSV as source of truth** (not PDF totals)
4. ✅ **Normalized database storage** (vendors, payment methods)

### What Doesn't Work
1. ❌ **PDF GRAND TOTAL reconciliation** (conversion formulas broken)
2. ❌ **Aggregate total matching** (exchange rates unknown)
3. ❌ **Daily total verification** (same issues as GRAND TOTAL)

### Critical Discovery
The CSV's "Conversion (USD)" column (column 8) has incorrect/placeholder exchange rates for months prior to a certain date. Examples:
- THB 19,000 rent → $0.55 (implies ~34,545 THB/USD - clearly wrong)
- THB amounts converted to tiny values ($0.01, $0.02)

This makes aggregate total reconciliation impossible. **Transaction-level matching is the only reliable verification method.**

## BATCH 2 COMPLETION ESTIMATE

- ✅ January: COMPLETE (100% verified)
- ⏳ February: 1 day (create + run verification)
- ⏳ March: 1 day (create + run verification)
- ⚠️  April: 2 days (fix parser, re-import, verify)

**Total**: ~4 days to complete Batch 2

## TOOLS CREATED

1. ✅ `verify-january-1to1.js` - Transaction-level verification script
2. ✅ `VERIFICATION-PROTOCOL-v2.0.md` - Updated verification methodology
3. ⏳ `verify-february-1to1.js` - TODO
4. ⏳ `verify-march-1to1.js` - TODO
5. ⏳ `verify-april-1to1.js` - TODO (after re-import)

**Protocol Version:** v2.0
**Last Updated:** October 29, 2025
**Status:** 1 of 4 months fully verified
**Next Action:** Fix April parser + verify Feb/Mar
