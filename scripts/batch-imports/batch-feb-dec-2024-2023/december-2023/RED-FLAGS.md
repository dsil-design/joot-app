## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE: DECEMBER 2023 CONVERSION RATE

**PROBLEM DETECTED:**
The CSV shows conversion rate of `$0.00003` for December 2023 THB transactions.
This is INCORRECT and causes rent to display as $0.71 instead of ~$710.

**Expected Conversion:** ~$0.0284 (December 2023 rate)
**CSV Shows:** $0.00003 (1000x too small!)

**Impact:**
- Rent: THB 25,000 × 0.00003 = $0.71 ❌
- Monthly Cleaning: THB 2,568 × 0.00003 = $0.07 ❌

**Solution:**
Parser MUST use proper conversion rate, NOT the CSV's displayed conversion.

```javascript
// For December 2023:
const DECEMBER_2023_CONVERSION_RATE = 0.0284; // Approximate Dec 2023 rate

if (row[6] && row[6].includes('THB')) {
  const thbAmount = parseFloat(row[6].match(/THB\s*([\d,.-]+)/)[1].replace(/,/g, ''));
  amount = thbAmount * DECEMBER_2023_CONVERSION_RATE; // Use proper rate
  currency = 'THB';
  originalAmount = thbAmount; // Store original THB amount
}
```

**Verification After Import:**
- Rent should be ~$710 USD, NOT $0.71
- Monthly cleaning should be ~$73 USD, NOT $0.07

---

## 📊 EXPECTED OUTCOMES

**After Import:**
- Total transactions in DB: ~119-124
- Expenses: ~113
- Income: ~6 + 6 refunds/winnings = ~12
- Tags applied: Business Expense, Reimbursement (as applicable)
- Rent transactions: 2 (USA $957 + Thailand converted properly)

**Post-Import Verification:**
```bash
# Verify tag application
node scripts/batch-imports/batch-feb-dec-2024-2023/december-2023/verify-december-2023-tags.js

# Expected output: Tag count > 0

# CRITICAL: Verify rent amount
# Should be ~$710, NOT $0.71
```
