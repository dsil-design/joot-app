## üîë CRITICAL TRANSACTIONS

### Dual Rent Payments (EXPECTED for transition month)
1. **USA Rent** (December - Conshy apartment)
   - Expected: $957.00 in early December
   - Verification: Found in CSV ‚úÖ
   - Description: "This Month's Rent, Storage, Internet, PECO (Conshy)"

2. **Thailand Rent** (First month - Chiang Mai condo)
   - Expected: THB 25,000 mid-December
   - Verification: Found in CSV ‚úÖ
   - **CRITICAL:** CSV shows erroneous conversion ($0.71) - MUST use raw THB amount per HARD RULE

### Major Flight Booking
- **EWR ‚Üí CNX (Singapore Airlines)**
  - Amount: $1,334.30
  - Verification: Found in CSV ‚úÖ
  - This is the relocation flight from USA to Thailand

### Additional Flights
- **CNX ‚Üí DAD (AirAsia):** $57.36 ‚úÖ
- **Train ticket (Amtrak):** $58.00 ‚úÖ

### Subscriptions (Expected 9-10)
Based on February and January patterns, expect:
- ‚úÖ Google Email (Work Email): $6.36
- ‚úÖ iPhone Payment: ~$54
- ‚úÖ Netflix: ~$24
- ‚úÖ YouTube Premium: ~$20
- ‚úÖ HBO Max: ~$17
- ‚úÖ iCloud: ~$10
- ‚úÖ Notion AI: ~$11
- ‚úÖ Paramount+: ~$13
- ‚úÖ T-Mobile: ~$70 (possibly last USA bill)

---

## üö© RED FLAGS (0 TOTAL)

### Assessment
No red flags identified in initial CSV review:
- ‚úÖ No negative amounts found
- ‚úÖ No refunds in December section
- ‚úÖ All income appears as positive amounts
- ‚úÖ Thailand rent has erroneous conversion BUT parser will correctly use raw THB per HARD RULE

**Risk Level:** üü¢ LOW - No blocking issues identified

---

## üîç CRITICAL CURRENCY HANDLING

### Thailand Rent - HARD RULE Verification

**CSV Data Found:**
```
Line: ,This Month's Rent,Pol,,,Bangkok Bank Account,THB 25000.00,,$0.71,$0.71
```

**Column Breakdown:**
- Column 6 (THB): `THB 25000.00` ‚Üê **USE THIS**
- Column 7 (USD): (empty)
- Column 8 (Conversion): `$0.71` ‚Üê **NEVER USE - ERRONEOUS**
- Column 9 (Subtotal): `$0.71` ‚Üê **NEVER USE**

**Parser Requirements:**
1. Extract `25000.00` from Column 6
2. Set currency = `'THB'`
3. NEVER use Column 8 or Column 9 values
4. Store as: `amount: 25000, currency: 'THB'`

**Why This Matters:**
The erroneous $0.71 conversion rate would value THB 25,000 at only $0.71 USD (exchange rate of $0.0000284 per THB), which is clearly wrong. The actual rate at the time was ~$0.028-0.030 per THB, making THB 25,000 worth ~$700-750 USD. The application handles all conversions at display time using correct rates.

## üìù MONTH-SPECIFIC NOTES

**Location Context:**
December 2023 is the relocation month from USA to Thailand:
- **Dec 1-12:** Final USA days (Conshohocken, PA apartment)
- **Dec 13:** Travel day (EWR airport departure)
- **Dec 14-31:** First Thailand days (Chiang Mai arrival)

**Expected Dual Costs:**
- Two rent payments (USA final + Thailand first)
- Major relocation flight ($1,334.30 EWR ‚Üí CNX)
- USA groceries/expenses early month
- Thailand groceries/expenses late month
- All USA subscriptions active
- Possible Thailand setup costs (SIM card, initial supplies)

**Travel Timeline:**
- Dec 12-13: Final USA days, packing, preparation
- Dec 13: Departure from EWR (Newark) via Singapore
- Dec 14: Arrival in CNX (Chiang Mai, Thailand)
- Dec 14-31: Initial Thailand setup period

**Expected Patterns:**
- High USD percentage (95-98%) - primarily USA month
- Small THB percentage (2-5%) - initial Thailand expenses
- One major expense: Relocation flight ($1,334.30)
- Dual rent payments (USA $957 + Thailand THB 25,000)
- All USA subscriptions billing normally
- Possible one-time costs: SIM card, phone setup, initial supplies

**Special Considerations:**
- **Emergency Savings $0.00:** Valid - relocation month with high costs
- **Erroneous Conversion Rate:** THB rent shows $0.71 instead of ~$700-750
- **Parser must ignore Column 8/9** for Thailand rent transaction
