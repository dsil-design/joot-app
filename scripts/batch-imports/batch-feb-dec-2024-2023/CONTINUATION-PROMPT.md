## 🔑 CRITICAL RULES & LEARNINGS

### HARD RULE: Currency Handling (MOST IMPORTANT)
**Parser MUST:**
- ✅ Extract raw amount (e.g., 25000) + currency symbol (e.g., 'THB')
- ✅ Store as: `amount=25000`, `original_currency='THB'`
- ❌ NEVER perform conversions
- ❌ NEVER use Column 8 (conversion column)
- ❌ NEVER multiply by exchange rates

**Rationale:** Application handles conversion at display time. CSV conversion rates may be wrong.

### Other Critical Rules
1. **All amounts must be positive** (database constraint)
   - Negative amounts in CSV → Convert to positive income
   - Refunds → Positive income transactions

2. **Proper CSV Parsing**
   - Use quote-aware `parseCSV()` function
   - Handles fields with commas inside quotes (e.g., `"Friday, February 2, 2024"`)

3. **Deduplication Key**
   - Must include merchant: `${date}_${description}_${amount}_${currency}_${merchant}`

4. **Tag Verification (Two-Step)**
   - Step 1: Verify tag count > 0
   - Step 2: Verify tag UUIDs match expected:
     - Savings/Investment: `c0928dfe-1544-4569-bbad-77fea7d7e5aa`
     - Reimbursement: `205d99a2-cf0a-44e0-92f3-e2b9eae1bf72`
     - Business Expense: `973433bd-bf9f-469f-9b9f-20128def8726`
     - Florida House: `178739fd-1712-4356-b21a-8936b6d0a461`

5. **Unicode Characters**
   - Database may have Unicode apostrophes (U+2019 `'`) instead of ASCII (`'`)
   - Use `\u2019` escape sequence in verification scripts

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### Step 1: Create January 2024 Import Script
```bash
# Copy February's proven import script
cp /Users/dennis/Code\ Projects/joot-app/scripts/batch-imports/batch-feb-dec-2024-2023/february-2024/import-february-2024.js \
   /Users/dennis/Code\ Projects/joot-app/scripts/batch-imports/batch-feb-dec-2024-2023/january-2024/import-january-2024.js

# Then adapt it:
# - Change all "february" → "january"
# - Change all "February" → "January"
# - Change all "225" → "170"
# - Update file path to january-2024-CORRECTED.json
# - Keep all other logic identical (proven pattern)
```

### Step 2: Run Import
```bash
cd /Users/dennis/Code\ Projects/joot-app/scripts/batch-imports/batch-feb-dec-2024-2023/january-2024
node import-january-2024.js
```

**Expected Results:**
- 170/170 transactions imported successfully
- ~80-90 vendors created/reused
- ~7-8 payment methods created/reused
- ~1-2 tags found and applied
- Zero errors
- Import time: ~60-90 seconds

### Step 3: Create Validation Script
```bash
# Copy February's proven validation script
cp /Users/dennis/Code\ Projects/joot-app/scripts/batch-imports/batch-feb-dec-2024-2023/february-2024/verify-february-2024.js \
   /Users/dennis/Code\ Projects/joot-app/scripts/batch-imports/batch-feb-dec-2024-2023/january-2024/verify-january-2024.js

# Then adapt it:
# - Change date range: '2024-02-01'/'2024-02-29' → '2024-01-01'/'2024-01-31'
# - Change expected counts: 225 → 170
# - Update critical transaction checks (see below)
```

### Step 4: Update Validation Checks
```javascript
const checks = [
  { desc: 'This Month\u2019s Rent, Storage, Internet, PECO (Conshy)', date: '2024-01-01', amount: 987, currency: 'USD' },
  { desc: 'This Month\u2019s Rent', date: '2024-01-19', amount: 25000, currency: 'THB', vendor: 'Pol' },
  { desc: 'Refund: Singapore Hotel', date: '2024-01-16', amount: 143.68, currency: 'USD', type: 'income' },
  { desc: 'Car Insurance Refund', date: '2024-01-18', amount: 89, currency: 'USD', type: 'income' },
  { desc: 'Drink reimbursement', date: '2024-01-21', amount: 150, currency: 'THB', type: 'income' },
  { desc: 'Refund: PAX Screens', date: '2024-01-27', amount: 37.09, currency: 'USD', type: 'income' },
  { desc: 'Travel Reimbursements', date: '2024-01-31', amount: 77.1, currency: 'USD', type: 'income', vendor: 'SingaporeAir' }
];
```

**NOTE:** Use Unicode escape `\u2019` for apostrophes (not regular `'`).

### Step 5: Run Validation
```bash
cd /Users/dennis/Code\ Projects/joot-app/scripts/batch-imports/batch-feb-dec-2024-2023/january-2024
node verify-january-2024.js
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ All tag counts match
- ✅ All 170 transactions present
- ✅ Both rent payments verified
- ✅ All 4 refunds as positive income
- ✅ Currency distribution correct (30% THB)
- ✅ No negative amounts in database

### Step 6: After January Validation Passes
Create completion documents:
- `PHASE-2-COMPLETE.md`
- `PHASE-3-COMPLETE.md`
- `PHASE-4-COMPLETE.md`

Then proceed to **December 2023** (Month 3 of 3).

## 🔧 PROVEN SCRIPT TEMPLATES

### Import Script Pattern (from February 2024)
- Uses Supabase service role credentials
- Map-based deduplication (vendors, payment methods, tags)
- Progress reporting every 25 transactions
- Error handling with detailed logging
- Tag lookup only (never creates tags)

**Key Functions:**
- `getUserId(email)`
- `getOrCreateVendor(name, userId, vendorMap)`
- `getOrCreatePaymentMethod(name, userId, paymentMap)`
- `getExistingTag(name, userId, tagMap)` (lookup only!)
- `createTransactionWithTags(transaction, dbIds)`

### Validation Script Pattern (from February 2024)
- Two-step tag verification
- Transaction count verification
- Currency distribution check
- Critical transaction verification (with Unicode support)
- Negative amount check (should be 0)

**Key Checks:**
1. Tag count matches expected
2. Tag UUIDs match expected
3. Transaction counts by type
4. Currency distribution within range
5. All critical transactions present with correct amounts
6. Zero negative amounts in database

---

## 🚨 COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### Issue 1: Unicode Apostrophe
**Problem:** Verification fails to find "This Month's Rent"
**Cause:** Database has U+2019 (`'`), script has ASCII (`'`)
**Solution:** Use `\u2019` escape sequence in JavaScript strings

### Issue 2: Pre-Flight Over-Estimation
**Problem:** Actual transactions < expected
**Pattern:** February expected 255, got 225; January expected 204, got 170
**Assessment:** This is ACCEPTABLE if:
- ✅ All critical transactions present
- ✅ Currency distribution correct
- ✅ No missing date ranges
- ✅ Quality checks pass

### Issue 3: Import Script "New Tags" Message
**Problem:** Script reports "New Tags: X" even when no duplicates created
**Cause:** Message checks script cache, not database
**Solution:** Ignore message, verify with database queries

---

## 💾 DATABASE CONNECTION

### Environment Variables (.env.local)
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://uwjmgjqongcrsamprvjr.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=[from .env.local file]
```

### User Account
```
Email: dennis@dsil.design
```

### Database Schema (Payment Methods - CRITICAL)
**ONLY use these fields:**
- `id` (uuid)
- `name` (text)
- `user_id` (uuid)
- `created_at` (timestamp)
- `updated_at` (timestamp)
- `sort_order` (integer)

**DO NOT use:**
- `icon` (doesn't exist)
- `color` (doesn't exist)
- `preferred_currency` (deprecated)

# CONTINUE BATCH IMPORT: January 2024 Phase 3

I am continuing a batch transaction import for the Joot app. **February 2024 is complete** (225 transactions imported and validated). **January 2024 Phase 2 is complete** (170 transactions parsed).

## Current Status
- ✅ February 2024: All 4 phases complete and validated
- ✅ January 2024 Phase 1: Pre-Flight complete
- ✅ January 2024 Phase 2: Parse & Prepare complete
- ⏸️ **January 2024 Phase 3: Database Import** ← **START HERE**
- ⏸️ January 2024 Phase 4: Validation
- ⏸️ December 2023: All phases

## Files Ready
- ✅ `january-2024-CORRECTED.json` exists with 170 transactions
- ✅ Parsed data includes:
  - Dual rent payments (USA $987 + Thailand THB 25,000)
  - 4 refunds converted to positive income
  - 170 total transactions (162 expenses + 8 income + 1 savings)
  - THB: 30.0% (within expected 20-30% range)

## Immediate Task
**Create and execute the January 2024 import script following the proven February 2024 pattern.**

### Step 1: Create Import Script
Base it on the proven template at:
`/Users/dennis/Code Projects/joot-app/scripts/batch-imports/batch-feb-dec-2024-2023/february-2024/import-february-2024.js`

Adapt for January:
- Change file path to `january-2024-CORRECTED.json`
- Change expected count from 225 → 170
- Update all console messages: "February" → "January"
- Keep all other logic identical (proven pattern)

### Step 2: Execute Import
Run the import script and verify:
- 170/170 transactions imported successfully
- Zero errors
- Vendors/payment methods/tags created correctly

### Step 3: Create Validation Script
Base it on:
`/Users/dennis/Code Projects/joot-app/scripts/batch-imports/batch-feb-dec-2024-2023/february-2024/verify-february-2024.js`

**Critical checks for January:**
1. Both rent payments present:
   - USA: "This Month\u2019s Rent, Storage, Internet, PECO (Conshy)" - $987 on 2024-01-01
   - Thailand: "This Month\u2019s Rent" - THB 25,000 on 2024-01-19
2. All 4 refunds as positive income
3. Currency distribution: 25-35% THB
4. Tag count: 1 (Savings/Investment)
5. Zero negative amounts

**IMPORTANT:** Use `\u2019` for apostrophes (Unicode issue learned from February).

### Step 4: Run Validation
Execute validation script and ensure all checks pass.

## Critical Rules
1. **HARD RULE:** Parser ONLY extracts raw amounts + currency. NEVER converts. App handles conversion.
2. All amounts must be positive (database constraint)
3. Use quote-aware CSV parser for fields with commas
4. Two-step tag verification (count + UUID)
5. Deduplication key includes merchant

## Reference Documents
All protocols, learnings, and context are in:
- `/Users/dennis/Code Projects/joot-app/scripts/batch-imports/batch-feb-dec-2024-2023/CONTINUATION-PROMPT.md`
- `/Users/dennis/Code Projects/joot-app/scripts/BATCH-IMPORT-PROTOCOL-v1.2.md`
- `/Users/dennis/Code Projects/joot-app/scripts/MONTHLY-TRANSACTION-IMPORT-PROTOCOL-v3.6.md`

**Please proceed with January 2024 Phase 3 (Database Import). Use the proven February 2024 patterns and maintain 100% accuracy.**
