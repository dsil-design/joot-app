## üêõ ISSUE ENCOUNTERED & RESOLVED

### Unicode Apostrophe Issue
**Problem:** Verification initially failed to find "This Month's Rent"

**Root Cause:** CSV/Database uses Unicode RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK (U+2019, char code 8217: `'`) while verification script used ASCII APOSTROPHE (char code 39: `'`)

**Resolution:** Updated verification script line 179 to use Unicode escape sequence:
```javascript
// Before (failed):
{ desc: 'This Month\'s Rent', ... }

// After (passed):
{ desc: 'This Month\u2019s Rent', ... }
```

**Impact:** None - this was a verification script bug, not a data import issue. The transaction was correctly imported to the database.

**Lesson Learned:** When validating transaction descriptions, account for Unicode characters (especially smart quotes, em-dashes, etc.) that may be present in source CSV data.
