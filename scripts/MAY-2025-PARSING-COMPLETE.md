## PARSING SCRIPT DETAILS

**Script:** `/scripts/parse-may-2025.js`
**Rules:** Following FINAL_PARSING_RULES.md exactly
**Date:** October 24, 2025

### Line Ranges Processed
- Expense Tracker: lines 1521-1757 (CSV lines 1520-1756)
- Gross Income Tracker: lines 1758-1771 (CSV lines 1757-1770)
- Personal Savings & Investments: lines 1772-1776 (CSV lines 1771-1775)
- Florida House Expenses: lines 1787-1801 (CSV lines 1786-1800)

### Currency Handling (CRITICAL)
- THB transactions: Parsed from Column 6 (e.g., "THB 35000.00")
- USD transactions: Parsed from Column 7 or Column 9
- Column 8 (conversion): IGNORED (never used)
- Currency stored correctly in final JSON

### Date Parsing
- Format 1: "Thursday, May 1, 2025" → "2025-05-01"
- Format 2: "5/1/2025" → "2025-05-01"
- All dates parsed correctly

### Tag Logic Applied
1. Reimbursement: Description starts with "Reimbursement:" → income + tag
2. Florida House: From Florida House section → expense + tag
3. Business Expense: Column 4 = "X" → expense + tag (0 found)
4. Savings/Investment: From Savings section → expense + tag
5. Reimbursable (Column 3 = "X"): NO TAG (tracking only)

---

## CONCLUSION

May 2025 parsing is **COMPLETE** and **READY FOR IMPORT**.

All critical validations passed:
- Rent transaction correct (35000 THB)
- Currency handling correct (no conversion errors)
- Tags applied correctly
- Duplicates removed per rules
- Missing amounts documented and acceptable

The 3-transaction difference from expected count is fully explained by transactions with missing/zero amounts, which were correctly excluded per parsing rules.

**Next Step:** Import to database using `node scripts/db/import-month.js scripts/may-2025-CORRECTED.json`
