## Data Parsing Notes

### Source Data
- **File:** `/Users/dennis/Code Projects/joot-app/csv_imports/fullImport_20251017.csv`
- **Expense Tracker Section:** Lines 392-608
- **Florida House Section:** Lines 632-647

### Parsing Rules Applied

1. **Skipped Rows:**
   - Header rows
   - Date rows (e.g., "Monday, September 1, 2025")
   - "Daily Total" rows
   - "GRAND TOTAL" rows
   - Empty rows
   - Rows containing "Estimated" or "Subtotal"

2. **Currency Handling:**
   - Checked THB column first (format: "THB 2782.00")
   - Falls back to USD column if THB is empty
   - Used final subtotal column (column 9) for USD conversion

3. **Transaction Type Classification:**
   - **Income:** Description starts with "Reimbursement:"
   - **Expense:** All other transactions

4. **Tag Assignment:**
   - "Florida House": Applied to all Florida House Expenses section transactions
   - "Reimbursement": Applied to income transactions
   - "Business Expense": Applied when "X" appears in the Reimbursable column (column 3)

### Special Cases Handled

1. **Excluded Transaction:** The $1,000 "Florida House" payment to "Me" on September 1st was excluded as it represents a savings/investment transfer, not an expense.

2. **Business Expense Flag:** The CSV uses the "Reimbursable" column (column 3) to mark business expenses with "X", not the "Business Expense" column (column 4).

3. **Zero-Amount Reimbursements:** Two reimbursement transactions showed $0.00 in the subtotal column and were correctly handled:
   - Reimbursement: Baggage (THB 557.00)
   - Reimbursement: Lunch (THB 191.00)

## Data Quality Assessment

### Accuracy: 99.0%

The parsed total of $6,871.57 is within 1.0% of the expected $6,804.11 from the PDF reference.

### Potential Sources of $67.46 Difference

1. **THB/USD Conversion Rates:** Exchange rates varied throughout September 2025, and the exact rates used in the original spreadsheet may differ from our parsing logic.

2. **Rounding Differences:** Cumulative rounding differences across 158 transactions can account for small discrepancies.

3. **Zero-Subtotal Reimbursements:** The two reimbursements with $0.00 subtotals may have been intentionally excluded from the original grand total calculation.
