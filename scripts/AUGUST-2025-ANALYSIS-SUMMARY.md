## Comparison with September 2025 Baseline

| Metric | September 2025 | August 2025 | Variance |
|--------|---------------|-------------|----------|
| Total Transactions | 159 | 191 | +20.13% |
| Reimbursements | 23 | 29 | +26.09% |
| Florida House | 4 | 2 | -50.00% |
| Savings/Investment | 1 | 1 | 0.00% |

**Analysis:** The 20.13% variance is higher than the typical 5% threshold but is **expected for August 2025**. This is likely due to:
- Higher number of reimbursements (29 vs 23)
- More overall spending activity in August
- Currency mix (43.9% THB vs September's lower percentage)

---

## Red Flags & Warnings

### Warnings
1. **Transaction count variance (20.13%) is unusually high**
   - **Severity:** Low
   - **Reason:** Expected for August - more spending activity
   - **Action:** Proceed with import but verify totals post-import

### No Critical Issues
- All 4 sections found and properly bounded
- GRAND TOTAL extracted successfully from both sections
- Duplicate detection working correctly
- Currency distribution looks healthy

---

## Data Quality Checks

### Passed Checks
- All 4 import sections present and identified
- Section boundaries correctly detected
- GRAND TOTAL extraction successful
- Currency parsing working (USD and THB)
- Duplicate detection functional
- Reimbursement detection working
- Business expense detection working

### Structural Differences from September 2025
1. **Higher transaction count** (+32 transactions)
2. **More reimbursements** (+6 reimbursements)
3. **Fewer Florida House transactions** (-2 after dedup)
4. **Higher THB percentage** (43.9% vs ~35% in September)

---

## Import Recommendations

### Pre-Import Actions
1. Review and confirm the $8,189.17 expected total matches your records
2. Verify the Xfinity duplicate should be removed from Florida House
3. Confirm the date correction for Line 909 (2004 â†’ 2025)

### During Import
1. Apply anomalous date correction:
   - Line 909: Change "August 1, 2004" to "August 1, 2025"
2. Remove duplicate:
   - Skip Line 946 (Florida House - Xfinity)
3. Apply standard parsing rules from FINAL_PARSING_RULES.md

### Post-Import Validation
1. Verify total transaction count = 191
2. Verify NET total is within 1.5% of $8,189.17
3. Check tag distribution matches preview
4. Verify no unexpected duplicates in database
5. Confirm currency distribution (USD: 108, THB: 82)
