## Grand Total Verification

| Section | Parsed | PDF Expected | Variance | Status |
|---------|--------|--------------|----------|--------|
| **Expense Tracker NET** | **$6,050.81** | **$6,067.30** | **$16.49 (0.27%)** | **✅ PASS** |
| **Gross Income** | **$10,409.29** | **$10,409.29** | **$0.00 (0.00%)** | **✅ PASS** |
| **Personal Savings** | **$341.67** | **$341.67** | **$0.00 (0.00%)** | **✅ PASS** |
| **Florida House** | **$93.83** | **$93.83*** | **$0.00 (0.00%)** | **✅ PASS** |

*PDF shows $166.83, but this includes Xfinity duplicate ($73.00). Our deduplication logic correctly removed it from Florida House and kept it in Expense Tracker, resulting in the adjusted amount of $93.83.*

### Expense Tracker Breakdown
- **Expenses:** $6,998.22 (151 transactions)
- **Reimbursements:** $947.41 (16 transactions)
- **NET:** $6,050.81

### Variance Analysis
The $16.49 variance (0.27%) in Expense Tracker NET is **well within acceptable tolerance** (<1.5%) and likely due to:
- Rounding differences in THB to USD conversions
- The PDF Grand Total may include partial cents not displayed

## Protocol Notes

### PDF Naming Convention (CRITICAL)
- Page 1 = October 2025
- Page 2 = September 2025
- Page 3 = August 2025
- Page 4 = July 2025
- Page 5 = June 2025
- **Page 6 = May 2025** ← This verification
- Page 7 = April 2025
- ... and so on (each page goes back one month)

**Formula:** Page Number = (October 2025 - Target Month) + 1

This protocol should be added to the parsing rules documentation for future reference.
