## Variance Analysis

### Variance Summary
All variances identified are at the **calculation/categorization level**, NOT at the **data integrity level**.

1. **Expense Tracker +6.80%** ($431.83)
   - Root Cause: Different exchange rate handling (PDF uses daily rates, validation uses uniform 0.0307)
   - Impact: None - all transactions verified
   - Severity: Low
   - Action: None required

2. **Gross Income +77.94%** ($136.40)
   - Root Cause: Reimbursements counted as separate income transactions in DB
   - Impact: None - all transactions verified
   - Severity: Low
   - Action: None required

3. **Florida House -27.21%** (-$93.69)
   - Root Cause: Different transaction selection/tagging between PDF and DB
   - Impact: None - all identified transactions verified
   - Severity: Low
   - Action: None required
