## ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual Action Required: Apply Storage RLS Policies

Due to network connectivity restrictions, the storage RLS policies need to be applied manually via the Supabase Dashboard.

### Steps to Apply RLS Policies:

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select project: `uwjmgjqongcrsamprvjr`

2. **Open SQL Editor**
   - Navigate to: SQL Editor (in left sidebar)
   - Click: "New Query"

3. **Copy Migration SQL**
   - File location: `database/migrations/20251029000001_add_storage_policies.sql`
   - Copy the entire contents (161 lines)

4. **Paste and Execute**
   - Paste SQL into the query editor
   - Click "Run" or press Cmd+Enter

5. **Verify Success**
   - You should see: "Success. No rows returned"
   - Check for any error messages

### What the Migration Does:

**Storage Policies (12 policies):**
- `documents` bucket:
  - Users can upload to their own folder only
  - Users can view/update/delete only their own files

- `thumbnails` bucket:
  - Anyone can view (public read)
  - Authenticated users can upload to their own folder
  - Users can update/delete their own thumbnails

- `vendor-logos` bucket:
  - Anyone can view (public read)
  - Authenticated users can upload/update
  - Only service role can delete (prevent accidents)

**Helper Functions (3 functions):**
- `get_document_storage_path()` - Generate document paths
- `get_thumbnail_storage_path()` - Generate thumbnail paths
- `get_vendor_logo_path()` - Generate logo paths

### Verification Query:

After applying the migration, run this query to verify policies were created:

```sql
SELECT
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  policyname,
  permissive,
  roles,
  cmd
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'storage'
  AND tablename = 'objects'
ORDER BY policyname;
```

You should see 12 policies listed.

## üîú Next Steps: Days 3-4

Once the RLS policies are applied, we're ready to proceed with:

### Day 3-4: Upload UI
1. Drag-drop upload component
2. File validation (PDF, images, emails)
3. Upload progress indicators
4. Thumbnail previews
5. API endpoint: `POST /api/documents/upload`
6. Document upload page/modal

### Day 5: Document Library
1. Document list view
2. Filter and search
3. Document detail view
4. Delete/download actions

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

Before proceeding to Days 3-4, verify:

- [ ] All 8 database tables exist in Supabase
- [ ] TypeScript types compile without errors
- [ ] 3 storage buckets are visible in Supabase Dashboard
- [ ] Storage RLS policies are applied (12 policies)
- [ ] Helper functions exist in database
- [ ] Both git commits are pushed to remote

### Quick Verification Commands:

```bash
# Verify TypeScript types compile
npx tsc --noEmit src/lib/supabase/types.ts

# Verify storage buckets
npx tsx scripts/setup-storage-buckets.ts

# Verify git commits
git log --oneline feature/document-management -2
```

---

## üìù Notes

- Network connectivity to Supabase database via psql is currently unavailable (IPv6 routing issue)
- All database changes can be applied via Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor
- Storage buckets are functional and ready for uploads
- Once RLS policies are applied, storage security will be enforced
- All code is production-ready and follows existing patterns

---

## üéØ Summary

**Week 1 Days 1-2 are complete!** All infrastructure is built and ready. The only remaining step is applying the storage RLS policies via the Supabase Dashboard (5-minute task).

Once that's done, we can immediately proceed with building the upload UI in Days 3-4.

**Status: 40% of Week 1 Complete** ‚úÖ
