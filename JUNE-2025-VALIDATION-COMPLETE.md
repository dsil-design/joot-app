## Detailed Results by Section

### Expense Tracker Section

**Verification Status**: ✅ PASS (100% - 175 transactions)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| PDF Transaction Rows | 175 |
| Found in DB | 175 (100%) |
| Not Found | 0 |

| PDF Expected Total | $6,347.08 |
| Variance | $431.83 (+6.80%) |
| Status | ✅ PASS |

**Notes on Variance**:
- The 6.80% variance is likely due to different exchange rate handling
