-- Baseline migration to establish initial database state
-- This migration marks the existing schema as the baseline
-- All tables and functions that exist before this point are considered part of the baseline

-- This is a marker migration that does nothing but establish a starting point
-- for the migration history. It allows subsequent migrations to be tracked properly.

-- The tables that should already exist at this point:
-- - public.users (without role column)
-- - public.transactions
-- - public.vendors  
-- - public.payment_methods
-- - public.exchange_rates
-- - public.currency_configuration

-- Mark this migration as the baseline
