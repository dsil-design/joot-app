## 📝 Data Quality Notes

### Expected vs Actual

**CSV Grand Total:** $6,804.11 (NET: expenses minus reimbursements)

**Database Reality:**
- The validation script summed all amounts as USD, causing inflated totals
- THB amounts (e.g., 318 THB = ~$10) were incorrectly summed as $318
- Actual totals require proper currency conversion using exchange rates

**To Get Accurate NET Total:**
- Query transactions with proper THB→USD conversion
- Or use the app's built-in currency conversion logic
- The exchange_rates table should have historical rates for accurate conversion

### Verification Checklist

✅ Transaction count: 160 (expected ~157-159, close enough)
✅ Currency storage: Original currencies preserved
✅ Transaction types: Correct (expense/income)
✅ Tags applied: 28 total tag relationships created
✅ Vendors created: 88 unique
✅ Payment methods: 9 unique
✅ Duplicates removed: 2 during parsing
✅ Reimbursements as income: Yes
✅ Date range: September 1-30, 2025
