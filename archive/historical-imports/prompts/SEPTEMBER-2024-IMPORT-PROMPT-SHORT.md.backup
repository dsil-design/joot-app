## üö® Critical Lessons from October 2024 (Most Recent)

### Issue #1: Missing Merchants/Payment Methods
- **Problem:** 7 transactions had no merchant or payment method in CSV
- **Solution:** Default to "Unknown" for both merchant AND payment method (UPDATED: payment method changed from "Bangkok Bank Account")
- **Lesson:** Flag missing merchants/payment methods early, use consistent "Unknown" default
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Strategy updated (both now use "Unknown")
- **Impact:** September 2024 may have similar pattern - flag and apply "Unknown" defaults

### Issue #2: Zero-Dollar Transactions
- **Problem:** 1 transaction with $0.00 amount (massage)
- **Solution:** User confirmed to skip entirely
- **Lesson:** Always flag $0.00 transactions for exclusion
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Established pattern
- **Impact:** Skip any $0.00 transactions in September 2024

### Issue #3: High Reimbursement Count
- **Problem:** October 2024 had 7 reimbursements (vs November 2024's 0)
- **Solution:** All correctly detected and converted to positive income
- **Lesson:** Reimbursement counts can vary significantly by month based on location/activities
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Expected pattern
- **Impact:** September 2024 reimbursement count may be high if user was in Thailand

### Issue #4: Healthy THB Percentage
- **Problem:** October 2024 had 57.1% THB (vs November 2024's 5.1% USA travel)
- **Solution:** Confirmed user was in Thailand during October 2024
- **Lesson:** THB percentage indicates user location (Thailand vs USA)
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Expected pattern
- **Impact:** September 2024 THB % will indicate if user was in Thailand or USA

### Issue #5: PDF Formula Errors
- **Problem:** Florida House PDF total showed $1,108.10 but transactions summed to $1,213.87
- **Solution:** Confirmed database is correct, PDF has spreadsheet formula error
- **Lesson:** Database is source of truth, not PDF grand totals
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Expected behavior
- **Impact:** Focus on transaction-by-transaction validation, not just grand totals

## üîß 4-Phase Import Process

### PHASE 1: Pre-Flight Analysis

**Agent:** Task tool ‚Üí subagent_type=data-engineer

**Objective:** Analyze CSV and PDF to understand data structure, identify issues, and set expectations BEFORE parsing.

**Critical Steps:**

**STEP 0 - PDF VERIFICATION (MUST DO FIRST):**
1. Read: `csv_imports/Master Reference PDFs/Budget for Import-page14.pdf`
2. Find first transaction date in "Expense Tracker" section
3. Verify it shows "September 2024" (e.g., "Tuesday, September 1, 2024")
4. If PDF shows ANY other month, STOP IMMEDIATELY and report error
5. Only proceed if PDF contains September 2024 data

**Tasks:**
1. Find line numbers for all 4 sections in CSV (before October 2024's line 3403)
2. Count transactions per section (raw count before deduplication)
3. Extract GRAND TOTALS from PDF (source of truth)
4. Calculate expected total: Expense Tracker NET + Florida House + Savings
5. Detect potential duplicates between sections
6. Count tag conditions (reimbursements, business expenses, etc.)
7. Identify currency distribution (USD vs THB - location indicator)
8. Verify parsing script status (needs creation)
9. Compare to other months (flag significant differences)
10. Identify anomalies (negative amounts, comma amounts, missing merchants, typos, unusual transactions)

**Output Files:**
- `scripts/SEPTEMBER-2024-PREFLIGHT-REPORT.md`
- `scripts/SEPTEMBER-2024-RED-FLAGS.md`

**Human Checkpoint:** ‚è∏Ô∏è Review pre-flight, address critical issues, provide guidance on unusual transactions, approve parsing strategy.

---

### PHASE 2: Parse & Prepare

**Agent:** Task tool ‚Üí subagent_type=data-engineer

**Objective:** Parse CSV data following FINAL_PARSING_RULES.md exactly, producing clean JSON for import.

**Prerequisites:**
- ‚úÖ Pre-flight report reviewed and approved
- ‚úÖ PDF verified as September 2024
- ‚úÖ Line ranges identified
- ‚úÖ User guidance provided for any unusual transactions

**Critical Requirements:**

1. **Currency Handling:** Use Column 6 for THB, Column 7/9 for USD, NEVER Column 8
2. **Negative Amounts:** Convert ALL negative expenses to positive income
3. **Comma-Formatted Amounts:** Clean $, commas, quotes, tabs, parentheses
4. **Reimbursement Detection:** Use regex `/^Re(im|mi|m)?burs[e]?ment:?/i`
5. **Florida House Dates:** Default to `2024-09-30` if missing
6. **Missing Merchants:** Default to "Unknown"
7. **Missing Payment Methods:** Default to "Unknown" (UPDATED: changed from "Bangkok Bank Account" per user request)
8. **Zero Amounts:** Skip entirely (per October 2024 lesson)

**Output Files:**
- `scripts/parse-september-2024.js`
- `scripts/september-2024-CORRECTED.json`
- `scripts/SEPTEMBER-2024-PARSE-REPORT.md`
- `scripts/SEPTEMBER-2024-RED-FLAGS.md` (updated)

**Human Checkpoint:** ‚è∏Ô∏è Verify rent amount, no negative amounts, user corrections applied, approve for import.

---

### PHASE 3: Database Import

**Execution:** Direct command (no agent needed)

**Prerequisites:**
- ‚úÖ Parse report reviewed and approved
- ‚úÖ Rent transaction verified (THB amount, not USD)
- ‚úÖ No negative amounts in JSON
- ‚úÖ Currency split verified
- ‚úÖ User corrections verified as applied

**Command:**
```bash
node scripts/db/import-month.js --file=scripts/september-2024-CORRECTED.json --month=2024-09
```

**Critical Post-Import Verification:**

1. **Tag Application Check:**
```bash
node scripts/check-september-tags.js
```

2. **Tag Mapping Check:**
```bash
node scripts/verify-september-tag-mapping.js
```

**Expected Tag IDs (verify mapping):**
- Reimbursement: `205d99a2-cf0a-44e0-92f3-e2b9eae1bf72`
- Florida House: `178739fd-1712-4356-b21a-8936b6d0a461`
- Business Expense: `973433bd-bf9f-469f-9b9f-20128def8726`
- Savings/Investment: `c0928dfe-1544-4569-bbad-77fea7d7e5aa`

**Human Checkpoint:** ‚è∏Ô∏è Verify import summary matches parse report, verify tags applied and mapped correctly.

---

### PHASE 4: Comprehensive Validation

**Agent:** Task tool ‚Üí subagent_type=data-scientist

**Objective:** Validate imported data against PDF source of truth using comprehensive multi-level verification with 100% transaction coverage.

**Prerequisites:**
- ‚úÖ Database import completed
- ‚úÖ Import summary reviewed
- ‚úÖ Tags verified as applied
- ‚úÖ Tags verified as mapped to existing IDs

**Validation Levels:**

1. **Level 1: Section Grand Totals** - Compare DB to PDF totals
2. **Level 2: Daily Subtotals** - Compare daily totals (‚â•50% within $1.00)
3. **Level 3: Transaction Count** - Exact match to import summary
4. **Level 4: Tag Distribution** - Exact match to parse report
5. **Level 5: Critical Transactions** - Spot check rent, reimbursements, refunds
6. **Level 6: 100% PDF Coverage** - Every transaction verified both directions

**Output Files:**
- `scripts/SEPTEMBER-2024-VALIDATION-REPORT.md`
- `scripts/SEPTEMBER-2024-COMPREHENSIVE-VALIDATION.md`
- `scripts/SEPTEMBER-2024-RED-FLAGS.md` (final update)

**Human Checkpoint:** ‚è∏Ô∏è Review validation report, accept/reject import based on results.
