# Monthly Transaction Import Protocol - June 2025

## üéØ Mission

Import June 2025 historical transaction data using the established Month-by-Month Import Protocol, maintaining data integrity and consistency with comprehensive PDF validation.

---

## üìö Knowledge Base - Established From Previous Imports

### Project Status

**Completed Imports:**
- ‚úÖ September 2025: 159 transactions, variance -2.24%
- ‚úÖ August 2025: 194 transactions, variance +2.24%
- ‚úÖ July 2025: 176 transactions, variance 1.7% (with comprehensive PDF validation)

**Current Database State (dennis@dsil.design):**
- Total transactions: ~529 (Sept + Aug + July)
- Vendors: 115+ (matched where possible)
- Payment methods: 25+
- Tags: Reimbursement, Florida House, Savings/Investment, Business Expense

**Next Target:** June 2025

**Critical Context:**
- May, June, and July 2025 were PREVIOUSLY imported with **INCORRECT** USD conversion values instead of original THB amounts
- All three months have been DELETED and July has been successfully re-imported with corrected data
- June 2025 needs to be re-imported using the **CORRECTED** parsing approach

---

## üìÅ Reference Files for June 2025

### Primary Sources
1. **PDF:** `/csv_imports/Master Reference PDFs/Budget for Import-page5.pdf` (June 2025)
   - Source of truth for validation
   - Contains 4 sections with grand totals
   - Use for 1:1 transaction verification

2. **CSV:** `/csv_imports/fullImport_20251017.csv`
   - Lines: TBD (to be identified in pre-flight)
   - Expected: ~1232-1519 based on May/July patterns

3. **Parsing Script:** `/scripts/parse-june-2025.js`
   - ‚úÖ ALREADY CORRECTED to use original currency values
   - Uses Column 6 for THB amounts (NOT conversion column)
   - Uses Column 7/9 for USD amounts (NOT conversion column)

4. **Import Script:** `/scripts/db/import-month.js`
   - ‚úÖ Verified working from Sept/Aug/July imports

### Supporting Documents
1. **`scripts/FINAL_PARSING_RULES.md`** - Complete parsing specification
2. **`COMPREHENSIVE-VALIDATION-PROTOCOL.md`** - NEW validation protocol (established with July)

## üîß Standard Import Workflow (4-Phase Process)

### PHASE 1: Pre-Flight Analysis

**Agent:** Task tool ‚Üí subagent_type=data-engineer

**Objective:** Analyze CSV and PDF to understand data structure, identify issues, and set expectations BEFORE parsing.

**Prompt:**
```
Analyze June 2025 data from csv_imports/fullImport_20251017.csv and csv_imports/Master Reference PDFs/Budget for Import-page5.pdf using scripts/FINAL_PARSING_RULES.md.

Tasks:
1. Find line numbers for all 4 sections in CSV:
   - Expense Tracker
   - Gross Income Tracker
   - Personal Savings & Investments
   - Florida House Expenses

2. Count transactions per section (raw count before deduplication)

3. Extract GRAND TOTALS from PDF (NOT CSV):
   - Expense Tracker NET total
   - Gross Income total
   - Savings/Investment total
   - Florida House total

4. Calculate expected total: Expense Tracker NET + Florida House + Savings

5. Detect potential duplicates between sections:
   - Compare Expense Tracker vs Florida House (same merchant + amount + date)
   - Document which version to keep (per FINAL_PARSING_RULES.md: keep Expense Tracker)

6. Count tag conditions:
   - Reimbursements: description starts with "Reimbursement:" (income type)
   - Business Expenses: column 4 has "X" (expense with tag)
   - Reimbursables: column 3 has "X" (tracking only, NO tag)
   - Florida House: from Florida House section (expense with tag)
   - Savings/Investment: from Savings section (expense with tag)

7. Identify currency distribution:
   - USD transactions (column 7/9 has value, column 6 no THB)
   - THB transactions (column 6 has "THB XXX")
   - Mixed/other patterns

8. Verify parsing script correctness:
   - Read scripts/parse-june-2025.js
   - Verify it uses Column 6 for THB (NOT Column 8 conversion)
   - Verify it uses Column 7/9 for USD (NOT Column 8 conversion)
   - Flag if script needs correction

9. Compare to previous months:
   - September 2025: 159 transactions, 23 reimbursements, ~70 THB
   - August 2025: 225 transactions, 32 reimbursements, 82 THB
   - July 2025: 176 transactions, 26 reimbursements, ~90 THB
   - Flag significant structural differences

10. Identify anomalies:
    - Missing amounts
    - Invalid dates (e.g., wrong year)
    - Unusual patterns
    - Data quality issues

Output Files:
- scripts/JUNE-2025-PREFLIGHT-REPORT.txt or .md

Report must include:
- Line number ranges for each section
- Transaction counts per section
- Expected totals from PDF (source of truth)
- Expected total calculation
- Duplicate detection results with line numbers
- Tag distribution preview (counts)
- Currency breakdown (USD vs THB vs other)
- Parsing script verification status
- Comparison to previous months
- Red flags or structural differences
- Parsing strategy recommendations

This is critical pre-import validation - flag any anomalies before we proceed to parsing.
```

**Human Review Checkpoint:** Address any red flags, clarifying questions, or script corrections before Phase 2.

---

### PHASE 2: Parse & Prepare

**Agent:** Task tool ‚Üí subagent_type=data-engineer

**Objective:** Parse CSV data following FINAL_PARSING_RULES.md exactly, producing clean JSON for import.

**Prerequisites:**
- ‚úÖ Pre-flight report reviewed and approved
- ‚úÖ Parsing script verified/corrected
- ‚úÖ Line ranges identified

**Prompt:**
```
Parse June 2025 transactions following scripts/FINAL_PARSING_RULES.md exactly.

Source: csv_imports/fullImport_20251017.csv
Line Ranges: [from pre-flight report]

Critical Requirements:
1. **Currency Handling (MOST IMPORTANT):**
   - THB transactions: Use Column 6 value (e.g., "THB 35000.00")
   - USD transactions: Use Column 7 or Column 9 (subtotal) value
   - NEVER use Column 8 (conversion column)
   - Store currency as 'THB' or 'USD' in the currency field
   - Store amount as the ORIGINAL currency amount (e.g., 35000 for THB, not 1074)

2. Parse all 4 sections:
   - Expense Tracker (lines X-Y from pre-flight)
   - Gross Income Tracker (lines X-Y)
   - Personal Savings & Investments (lines X-Y)
   - Florida House Expenses (lines X-Y)

3. Apply tag logic:
   - "Reimbursement": description starts with "Reimbursement:" ‚Üí income type + tag
   - "Florida House": from Florida House section ‚Üí expense type + tag
   - "Business Expense": column 4 has "X" ‚Üí expense type + tag
   - "Savings/Investment": from Savings section ‚Üí expense type + tag
   - Reimbursable (column 3): NO tag, tracking only

4. Handle duplicates:
   - Remove duplicates between Expense Tracker and Florida House
   - Keep Expense Tracker version per FINAL_PARSING_RULES.md
   - Document which transactions were removed

5. Date conversion:
   - "Monday, June 1, 2025" ‚Üí "2025-06-01"
   - "6/1/2025" ‚Üí "2025-06-01"
   - Apply any date corrections identified in pre-flight

6. Transaction structure:
   ```json
   {
     "date": "2025-06-01",
     "description": "This Month's Rent",
     "merchant": "Landlord",
     "payment_method": "Bangkok Bank Account",
     "amount": 35000,
     "currency": "THB",
     "transaction_type": "expense",
     "tags": []
   }
   ```

Expected Outputs (from pre-flight):
- Total transactions: [from pre-flight]
- Transaction types: [expenses vs income counts]
- Tag distribution:
  - Reimbursement: [count]
  - Florida House: [count]
  - Business Expense: [count]
  - Savings/Investment: [count]
- Currency split: [USD vs THB counts]
- Duplicates removed: [list]

Output Files:
1. scripts/june-2025-CORRECTED.json - Parsed transaction data
2. scripts/JUNE-2025-PARSE-REPORT.md - Detailed parsing report

Parse Report Must Include:
- Transaction counts by section
- Transaction counts by type (expense vs income)
- Tag distribution (actual counts)
- Currency distribution (USD vs THB)
- Duplicates removed (with details)
- Expected totals from CSV
- Date corrections applied (if any)
- Warnings or issues encountered
- Sample transactions (first 5 from each section)

Critical Verification:
- Rent transaction MUST be 35000 THB (NOT ~1074 USD)
- All THB transactions stored as THB with original amounts
- All USD transactions stored as USD with original amounts
```

**Human Review Checkpoint:**
1. Verify parse report totals match pre-flight expectations
2. Verify rent transaction is 35000 THB
3. Verify currency distribution looks correct
4. Approve before database import

---

### PHASE 3: Database Import

**Execution:** Direct command (no agent needed)

**Prerequisites:**
- ‚úÖ Parse report reviewed and approved
- ‚úÖ Rent transaction verified as 35000 THB
- ‚úÖ Currency split verified

**Command:**
```bash
node scripts/db/import-month.js \
  --file=scripts/june-2025-CORRECTED.json \
  --month=2025-06
```

**What This Does:**
- Matches existing vendors (115+ in database)
- Matches existing payment methods (25+ in database)
- Matches existing tags (Reimbursement, Florida House, Savings/Investment, Business Expense)
- Creates new vendors/payment methods only when no match found
- Skips duplicate transactions (same date + description + amount + vendor)
- Inserts transactions in batches of 50
- Creates transaction_tag relationships
- Reports: new vendors, new payment methods, import counts

**Expected Output:**
- Transaction count: [from parse report]
- Transaction types: X expenses, Y income
- New vendors created: [list]
- New payment methods created: [list]
- Tags applied: [counts]

**Verification:**
- Import summary should match parse report counts
- No unexpected duplicates skipped
- Tags applied correctly

## üö® Red Flags - Stop and Investigate

**Parsing Issues:**
- Rent transaction ‚â† 35000 THB
- Currency field shows "USD" for Thai rent
- Amount shows ~1074 instead of 35000
- THB transactions stored as USD amounts
- Conversion column (column 8) being used

**Import Issues:**
- Transaction count doesn't match parse report
- Large number of duplicates skipped unexpectedly
- Tags not applied correctly
- New vendors created when they should match existing

**Validation Issues:**
- Variance >5% on any section grand total
- Daily variance >$100 on any day
- Transaction count mismatch
- Tag count mismatch

- PDF match rate <90%

---

## üîÑ Recovery Procedures

### If Parsing Script is Wrong
1. Stop before database import
2. Fix parsing script currency logic
3. Re-run Phase 2 (parse)
4. Verify rent = 35000 THB in new output
5. Proceed to Phase 3

### If Import Goes Wrong
1. Delete June 2025 transactions from database
2. Fix issue (parsing script or import script)
3. Re-run from Phase 2
4. Re-import to database

### If Validation Fails
1. Investigate discrepancies in validation report
2. Determine root cause:
   - Parsing error ‚Üí fix script, re-parse, re-import
   - Import error ‚Üí delete and re-import
   - PDF vs CSV mismatch ‚Üí document and accept if minor
3. Re-run validation after fix
