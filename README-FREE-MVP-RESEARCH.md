**Details:** See FREE-MVP-RESEARCH-REPORT-2025.md Section 4

---

### Q5: What are the limitations we'll hit?

**Answer:**
| Limit | Threshold | Solution |
|-------|-----------|----------|

## COST AT DIFFERENT SCALES

### Personal (50 receipts/month)
**Cost: $0 forever**
- All free tiers sufficient
- Storage: 10MB used
- API calls: Well within limits

### Small Business (500 receipts/month)
**Cost: $0 for 6 months, then $0.50/month**
- Gemini slightly exceeded after month 6
- Storage still under 1GB
- Database still under 500MB

### Growing Business (2,000 receipts/month)
**Cost: $28/month starting month 7**
- Supabase Pro: $25/month (database grows)
- Gemini: $3/month overage
- Still very affordable

### Established Business (10,000 receipts/month)
**Cost: ~$100/month**
- Supabase Pro: $25/month
- Gemini API: $4/month
- Additional services: ~$70/month

## IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE

**Day 1 (3 hours):** Core infrastructure
- Create Supabase account
- Get Gemini API key
- Set up hosting (Render)
- Deploy basic API

**Day 2 (2 hours):** Processing pipeline
- Implement OCR
- Implement extraction
- Implement matching
- Set up job queue

**Day 3 (1 hour):** Polish

- Testing

**Total:** 2-3 hours to working MVP

---

## KEY SUCCESS FACTORS

1. **Start with Tesseract** - Free, self-hosted, good enough for MVP
2. **Use Gemini API** - Best free tier by far (250/day)
3. **Supabase all the way** - Database + storage + auth
4. **pg-boss for jobs** - Leverages existing PostgreSQL
5. **Monitor quota daily** - Track API usage to stay free as long as possible
6. **Implement fallbacks** - Ollama for when Gemini quota exceeded
