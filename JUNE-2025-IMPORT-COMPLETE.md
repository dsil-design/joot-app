## What Was Fixed

**Problem:** May, June, and July 2025 were previously imported with USD conversion values instead of original THB amounts.

**Solution:**
- Corrected parsing script to use column 6 (Actual Spent) for THB amounts
- Re-parsed June 2025 data with corrected script
- Imported to database with original currency values preserved

**Result:**
- ✅ Rent now shows 35,000 THB (not 1074.50)
- ✅ All THB transactions have correct original amounts
- ✅ Currency attribution is accurate across all transactions
