# Monthly Transaction Import Protocol - April 2025

üéØ **Mission**: Import April 2025 historical transaction data using the established 4-Phase Import Protocol v3.1 with 100% comprehensive validation and red flag logging.

---

## üìö Knowledge Base - Current Status

### Completed Imports:
1. ‚úÖ **September 2025**: 159 transactions, variance -2.24%
2. ‚úÖ **August 2025**: 194 transactions, variance +2.24%
3. ‚úÖ **July 2025**: 176 transactions, variance 1.7%
4. ‚úÖ **June 2025**: 190 transactions, variance +3.18%, **100% verified**
5. ‚úÖ **May 2025**: 174 transactions, variance 0.29%, **100% verified with red flag logging**

### Current Database State (dennis@dsil.design):
- **Total transactions**: ~893 (Sept + Aug + July + June + May)
- **Vendors**: 273+ (197 original + 76 from May)
- **Payment methods**: 39+ (32 original + 7 from May)
- **Tags**: Reimbursement, Florida House, Savings/Investment, Business Expense

### Next Target: **April 2025**

### Critical Context:
- May 2025 was the FIRST import using enhanced protocol v3.1 with comprehensive red flag logging
- All currency values correctly stored as original amounts (THB/USD, not converted)
- Red flag logging successfully tracked 10 issues across all 4 phases
- Pre-flight analysis can be conservative - actual imports may capture more data than flagged

## üîß 4-Phase Import Process

### PHASE 1: Pre-Flight Analysis

**Agent**: Task tool ‚Üí subagent_type=data-engineer

**Objective**: Analyze CSV and PDF to understand data structure, identify issues, and set expectations BEFORE parsing.

**Prompt**:
```
Analyze April 2025 data from csv_imports/fullImport_20251017.csv and csv_imports/Master Reference PDFs/Budget for Import-page5.pdf using scripts/FINAL_PARSING_RULES.md.

Tasks:
1. Find line numbers for all 4 sections in CSV:
   - Expense Tracker
   - Gross Income Tracker
   - Personal Savings & Investments
   - Florida House Expenses

2. Count transactions per section (raw count before deduplication)

3. Extract GRAND TOTALS from PDF (NOT CSV):
   - Expense Tracker NET total
   - Gross Income total
   - Savings/Investment total
   - Florida House total

4. Calculate expected total: Expense Tracker NET + Florida House + Savings

5. Detect potential duplicates between sections:
   - Compare Expense Tracker vs Florida House (same merchant + amount + date)
   - Document which version to keep (per FINAL_PARSING_RULES.md: keep Expense Tracker)

6. Count tag conditions:
   - Reimbursements: description starts with "Reimbursement:" (income type)
   - Business Expenses: column 4 has "X" (expense with tag)
   - Reimbursables: column 3 has "X" (tracking only, NO tag)
   - Florida House: from Florida House section (expense with tag)
   - Savings/Investment: from Savings section (expense with tag)

7. Identify currency distribution:
   - USD transactions (column 7/9 has value, column 6 no THB)
   - THB transactions (column 6 has "THB XXX")
   - Mixed/other patterns

8. Verify parsing script correctness:
   - Check if scripts/parse-april-2025.js exists
   - If exists: verify it uses Column 6 for THB (NOT Column 8 conversion)
   - If exists: verify it uses Column 7/9 for USD (NOT Column 8 conversion)
   - If NOT exists: flag that script needs to be created following parse-may-2025.js pattern
   - Flag if script needs correction

9. Compare to previous months:
   - September 2025: 159 transactions, 23 reimbursements, ~70 THB
   - August 2025: 194 transactions, 32 reimbursements, 82 THB
   - July 2025: 176 transactions, 26 reimbursements, ~90 THB
   - June 2025: 190 transactions, 27 reimbursements, 85 THB
   - May 2025: 174 transactions, 16 reimbursements, 89 THB
   - Flag significant structural differences

10. Identify anomalies:
    - Missing amounts
    - Invalid dates (e.g., wrong year)
    - Unusual patterns
    - Data quality issues

Output Files:
- scripts/APRIL-2025-PREFLIGHT-REPORT.md
- scripts/APRIL-2025-RED-FLAGS.md (for tracking anomalies/issues for later review)

Report must include:
- Line number ranges for each section
- Transaction counts per section
- Expected totals from PDF (source of truth)
- Expected total calculation
- Duplicate detection results with line numbers
- Tag distribution preview (counts)
- Currency breakdown (USD vs THB vs other)
- Parsing script verification status (exists/needs creation/needs correction)
- Comparison to previous months
- Red flags or structural differences
- Parsing strategy recommendations

Red Flag Log Must Include:
For EACH anomaly/issue discovered:
- Transaction details (date, description, amount, line number)
- Issue type (missing amount, invalid date, duplicate, parsing error, etc.)
- Severity (CRITICAL / WARNING / INFO)
- Phase detected (Pre-Flight / Parsing / Import / Validation)
- Status (OPEN / RESOLVED / ACCEPTED)
- Notes/context

CRITICAL VERIFICATION:
- Verify rent transaction should be THB 35,000.00 (NOT ~$1074)
- Verify parsing script uses Column 6 for THB amounts (or flag if needs creation)
- Verify parsing script does NOT use Column 8 (conversion column)

This is critical pre-import validation - flag any anomalies before we proceed to parsing.

IMPORTANT: Create both output files (report and red flag log) with all findings. Return a summary of the key findings including any red flags that need human review before proceeding.

NOTE: May 2025 pre-flight was overly conservative - some flagged transactions were successfully imported. Don't over-flag issues.
```

**Output**:
- `scripts/APRIL-2025-PREFLIGHT-REPORT.md`
- `scripts/APRIL-2025-RED-FLAGS.md`

**Human Checkpoint**: ‚è∏Ô∏è Review pre-flight report and red flag log, address any critical issues before Phase 2.

---

### PHASE 2: Parse & Prepare

**Agent**: Task tool ‚Üí subagent_type=data-engineer

**Objective**: Parse CSV data following FINAL_PARSING_RULES.md exactly, producing clean JSON for import.

**Prerequisites**:
- ‚úÖ Pre-flight report reviewed and approved
- ‚úÖ Parsing script verified/corrected/created
- ‚úÖ Line ranges identified

**Prompt**:
```
Parse April 2025 transactions following scripts/FINAL_PARSING_RULES.md exactly.

Source: csv_imports/fullImport_20251017.csv

Line Ranges: [from pre-flight report]

Critical Requirements:

1. **Currency Handling (MOST IMPORTANT):**
   - THB transactions: Use Column 6 value (e.g., "THB 35000.00")
   - USD transactions: Use Column 7 or Column 9 (subtotal) value
   - NEVER use Column 8 (conversion column)
   - Store currency as 'THB' or 'USD' in the currency field
   - Store amount as the ORIGINAL currency amount (e.g., 35000 for THB, not 1074)

2. Parse all 4 sections:
   - Expense Tracker (lines X-Y from pre-flight)
   - Gross Income Tracker (lines X-Y)
   - Personal Savings & Investments (lines X-Y)
   - Florida House Expenses (lines X-Y)

3. Apply tag logic:
   - "Reimbursement": description starts with "Reimbursement:" ‚Üí income type + tag
   - "Florida House": from Florida House section ‚Üí expense type + tag
   - "Business Expense": column 4 has "X" ‚Üí expense type + tag
   - "Savings/Investment": from Savings section ‚Üí expense type + tag
   - Reimbursable (column 3): NO tag, tracking only

4. Handle duplicates:
   - Remove duplicates between Expense Tracker and Florida House
   - Keep Expense Tracker version per FINAL_PARSING_RULES.md
   - Document which transactions were removed

5. Date conversion:
   - "Monday, April 1, 2025" ‚Üí "2025-04-01"
   - "4/1/2025" ‚Üí "2025-04-01"
   - Apply any date corrections identified in pre-flight

6. Transaction structure:
   ```json
   {
     "date": "2025-04-01",
     "description": "This Month's Rent",
     "merchant": "Landlord",
     "payment_method": "Bangkok Bank Account",
     "amount": 35000,
     "currency": "THB",
     "transaction_type": "expense",
     "tags": []
   }
   ```

Expected Outputs (from pre-flight):
- Total transactions: [from pre-flight]
- Transaction types: [expenses vs income counts]
- Tag distribution:
  - Reimbursement: [count]
  - Florida House: [count]
  - Business Expense: [count]
  - Savings/Investment: [count]
- Currency split: [USD vs THB counts]
- Duplicates removed: [list]

Output Files:
1. scripts/april-2025-CORRECTED.json - Parsed transaction data
2. scripts/APRIL-2025-PARSE-REPORT.md - Detailed parsing report
3. scripts/APRIL-2025-RED-FLAGS.md - APPEND new issues found during parsing

Parse Report Must Include:
- Transaction counts by section
- Transaction counts by type (expense vs income)
- Tag distribution (actual counts)
- Currency distribution (USD vs THB)
- Duplicates removed (with details)
- Expected totals from CSV
- Date corrections applied (if any)
- Warnings or issues encountered
- Sample transactions (first 5 from each section)

Critical Verification:
- Rent transaction MUST be 35000 THB (NOT ~1074 USD)
- All THB transactions stored as THB with original amounts
- All USD transactions stored as USD with original amounts

Red Flag Logging:
- APPEND any new parsing errors, currency issues, or anomalies to scripts/APRIL-2025-RED-FLAGS.md
- Include line numbers, transaction details, and resolution status
- Flag duplicates removed for human review (mark as INFO/RESOLVED)
- Log any transactions excluded due to missing data

IMPORTANT: If parsing script doesn't exist, create it following scripts/parse-may-2025.js as template. Run the parsing script and create all output files (JSON, report, and updated red flag log). Return a summary showing transaction counts, rent verification, currency distribution, and ready-for-import confirmation.
```

**Output**:
- `scripts/april-2025-CORRECTED.json`
- `scripts/APRIL-2025-PARSE-REPORT.md`
- `scripts/APRIL-2025-RED-FLAGS.md` (updated)

**Human Checkpoint**: ‚è∏Ô∏è Verify rent = 35000 THB, currency split correct, review red flags, approve for import.

---

### PHASE 3: Database Import

**Execution**: Direct command (no agent needed)

**Prerequisites**:
- ‚úÖ Parse report reviewed and approved
- ‚úÖ Rent transaction verified as 35000 THB
- ‚úÖ Currency split verified

**Command**:
```bash
node scripts/db/import-month.js --file=scripts/april-2025-CORRECTED.json --month=2025-04
```

**What This Does**:
- Matches existing vendors (273+ in database from previous imports)
- Matches existing payment methods (39+ in database)
- Matches existing tags (Reimbursement, Florida House, Savings/Investment, Business Expense)
- Creates new vendors/payment methods only when no match found
- Skips duplicate transactions (same date + description + amount + vendor)
- Inserts transactions in batches of 50
- Creates transaction_tag relationships
- Reports: new vendors, new payment methods, import counts

**Expected Output**:
```
üì• INCREMENTAL MONTH IMPORT

  - Reimbursement: expected [from parse report]
  - Florida House: expected [from parse report]
  - Business Expense: expected [from parse report]
  - Savings/Investment: expected [from parse report]
- Compare to parse report expected counts
- Acceptance: Exact match

LEVEL 5: Critical Transaction Spot Checks

- Verify rent transaction:
  - Description: "This Month's Rent" (or similar)
  - Amount: 35000
  - Currency: THB
  - Date: 2025-04-XX (find in PDF)
- Verify largest THB transaction
- Verify largest USD transaction
- Verify first and last transaction of month
- Acceptance: All match PDF

LEVEL 6: 100% Comprehensive 1:1 PDF Verification

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: This is NOT a spot check or sample-based verification. You must verify EVERY transaction in both directions (PDF‚ÜíDB and DB‚ÜíPDF).

Task 6.1: PDF ‚Üí Database Verification (100% Coverage)

For EACH section in the PDF:
1. Extract ALL transaction rows (ignore headers/totals/summaries)

   - Date: exact match
   - Description: fuzzy match ‚â•80% similarity acceptable
   - Amount: within $0.10 tolerance
   - Currency: exact match (THB or USD)
3. Create complete verification table showing ALL transactions

Items to IGNORE from PDF (document but don't count as missing):
- Section header rows
- Column header rows
- Daily total summary rows
- Grand total rows
- Blank/separator rows
- Date-only rows (calendar markers)

Track statistics:
- Total PDF transaction rows: XXX
- Found in DB: XXX (XX.X%)
- Not found: X (list EVERY missing transaction)
- Amount mismatches >$0.10: X (list EVERY mismatch)
- Currency mismatches: X (list EVERY mismatch)

Task 6.2: Database ‚Üí PDF Verification (100% Coverage)

2. For EVERY database transaction:
   - Which section should it be in based on tags/type?
   - Is it present in that section?
   - Do amounts and currency match?
3. Create complete verification table showing ALL transactions

Track statistics:
- Total DB transactions: XXX
- Found in PDF: XXX (XX.X%)
- Not found: X (list EVERY extra transaction)
- Wrong section: X (list EVERY misplaced transaction)
- Amount mismatches >$0.10: X (list EVERY mismatch)

Task 6.3: Discrepancy Analysis

For EVERY discrepancy found:
1. Document in detail (what's in PDF vs what's in DB)
2. Root cause analysis (parsing error, duplicate removal, import logic, data entry)
3. Classify: CRITICAL (must fix) / WARNING (review needed) / ACCEPTABLE (minor)

Output Files:
1. scripts/APRIL-2025-VALIDATION-REPORT.md - Executive summary and all validation levels
2. scripts/APRIL-2025-COMPREHENSIVE-VALIDATION.md - Complete 1:1 verification tables

   - Discrepancy Details: [EVERY discrepancy with root cause]

8. Final Recommendation
   - ‚úÖ ACCEPT: All levels pass, variance within acceptable range
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è ACCEPT WITH NOTES: Minor issues documented, variance acceptable
   - ‚ùå REJECT: Critical issues found, re-import required

Acceptance Criteria (Overall):
- Level 1: All sections within variance thresholds
- Level 2: ‚â•50% daily match rate within $1.00 (lowered based on May learnings), no day >$100 variance
- Level 3: Exact transaction count match
- Level 4: Exact tag distribution match
- Level 5: All critical transactions verified
- Level 6: 100% of PDF transactions found in DB, 100% of DB transactions found in PDF

Red Flag Logging:
- APPEND ALL validation discrepancies to scripts/APRIL-2025-RED-FLAGS.md
- For each discrepancy: transaction details, variance amount, root cause, severity
- For missing transactions: full details from PDF or DB
- For amount mismatches: both values and difference
- For currency mismatches: expected vs actual
- Daily variances >$5.00 should be logged as WARNING

IMPORTANT:
1. Use Supabase client to query the database
2. Read the PDF to extract ALL transaction rows (not samples)
3. Create comprehensive validation report with complete verification tables
4. Verify EVERY transaction in BOTH directions
5. APPEND all discrepancies to red flag log with full details
6. Return executive summary with pass/fail status and variance percentages

NOTE from May 2025 validation:
- THB‚ÜíUSD conversion rounding is expected and acceptable
- Daily match rate of 50-60% is acceptable if all variances <$100
- Database may be more accurate than PDF in some cases (data entry errors in PDF)
- Pre-flight warnings about missing amounts may be false positives
```

**Output**:
- `scripts/APRIL-2025-VALIDATION-REPORT.md`
- `scripts/APRIL-2025-COMPREHENSIVE-VALIDATION.md`
- `scripts/APRIL-2025-RED-FLAGS.md` (final update with all issues)

**Human Checkpoint**: ‚è∏Ô∏è Review validation report and complete red flag log, accept/reject import based on results.

6. Proceed to Phase 3

### If Import Goes Wrong:
1. Delete April 2025 transactions from database
2. Fix issue (parsing script or import script)
3. Re-run from Phase 2
4. Re-import to database

### If Validation Fails:
1. Investigate discrepancies in validation report
2. Determine root cause:
   - Parsing error ‚Üí fix script, re-parse, re-import
   - Import error ‚Üí delete and re-import
   - PDF vs CSV mismatch ‚Üí document and accept if minor
3. Re-run validation after fix

- ‚úÖ ALWAYS verify 100% of transactions bidirectionally
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS log ALL anomalies in red flag log across all phases
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Pre-flight warnings may be conservative - actual import may capture more
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Daily match rate 50-60% is acceptable if all variances <$100
- ‚ö†Ô∏è THB‚ÜíUSD rounding differences are expected and acceptable
- ‚ùå NEVER skip human review checkpoints
- ‚ùå NEVER calculate exchange rates during parsing (store original values)
- ‚ùå NEVER use conversion column (column 8) from CSV
- ‚ùå NEVER use sampling/spot checks - verify EVERY transaction
